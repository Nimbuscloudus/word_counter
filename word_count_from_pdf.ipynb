Written analyses of literary\\n\\nrepresentation of sport of the past, in our case of wrestling, are demanding and very complex tasks. First of all,\\n\\nthey require finding translations of the original literary works. The complexity of history and ancient literary texts\\n\\nrequire from the writer to contextualize and recontextualize the period in which they were written. Yet for all\\n\\nthese challenges, examination of literary representation of wrestling was worthwhile because it provided us\\n\\ninsight into the ways which literature and sport were always connected, presented, and transmitted. By reading the\\n\\nabovementioned literary works in the present we are able to understand better the literary works of today that\\n\\npresent the same connection of sport and literature, in a slightly different way, as did those from the past. In\\n\\naddition, the authors believe that there is a need for the further research that would gather new international\\n\\nreferences to advance this argument.\\n\\n5. References\\n\\nAlter, J. S.

              " '© Centre for Promoting Ideas, USA www.ijhssnet.com\\nThe eighth child born to Devaki and Vasudeva was Krishna. Krishna was saved from Kamsa\\'s wrath and raised by\\na cowherd couple, Nanda and Yasoda. But when Kamsa heard that Krishna, the eight children, was alive he\\ndecided to kill him. He called Krishna and Balarama to the \"Harbour festival\" where a wrestling match was to be\\nheld. The two brothers defeated Kamsa\\'s wrestlers in a match. Kamsa was prepared for Krishna\\'s attack, for he\\nknew from the beginning that He was to be the cause of his death. He immediately unsheathed his sword and\\nprepared to answer the challenge of Krishna with sword and shield. As Kamsa wielded his sword up and down,\\nhither and thither, Krishna caught hold of him with great force knocking the crown from his head. He then\\ndragged Kamsa from his seat to the wrestling dais and threw him down. Then Krishna at once straddled his chest\\nand began to strike him over and over again. Simply from the strokes of Krishna\\'s fist, Kamsa was killed\\n(Prabhupada, 1970).\\n\\nAnother example of the connection between sport and literature can be found in the two major Sanskrit epics of\\nancient India, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana (Datta, 1988). The oldest preserved parts of the Mahabharata\\nare not thought to be appreciably older than around 400 B.C., though the origins of the story probably date\\nbetween the 8th and 9th centuries B.C. It is in this epic that we find the longest described wrestling match. It\\nhappened between Bheema, one of five Phandva brothers, and Jarasandha, a great and legendary king of\\nMagadha.\\n\\nYudhisthira, king of Indraprastha and later of Hastinapura (Kuru) and the leader of the Pandava side in the\\nKurukshetra War, was planning to make a Rajasuya yagna, a sacrifice performed by the ancient kings of India\\nwho considered themselves powerful enough to be an emperor (Dowson, 1870), in order to become an emperor\\nhimself. Krishna convinced him that Jarasandha was the only obstacle to oppose Yudhisthira from becoming an\\nemperor. Krishna planned a clever scheme to make Bheema wrestle with the proud but ageing Jarasandha. The\\nwrestling match lasted 27 days. They wrestled in the Malla-yuddha way, i.e. in a way that was to become the\\ntraditional South Asian form of combat-wrestling (Alter, 1992). Krishna knew the secret by which Jarasandha\\ncould be killed. Since Jarasandha was brought to life when the two lifeless halves joined together, conversely, he\\ncan be killed only when his body was torn into two halves. Krishna took a stick, broke it into two and threw them\\nin both directions. Bheema got the hint. He tore Jarasandha\\'s body into two and threw the pieces in two directions.\\nBut, these two pieces came together and Jarasandha was able to attack Bheema again. Bheema got tired after\\nseveral such futile attempts. He again sought the help of Krishna. This time, Krishna took a stick, broke it into\\ntwo and threw the left piece on right side and the right piece on the left side. Bheema precisely followed the same.\\nNow, he tore Jarasandha\\'s body into two and threw them in opposite directions. Thus, Jarasandha was killed as the\\ntwo pieces could not merge into one.\\n\\nOther early literary descriptions of wrestling matches, in the ancient epics of India, include the story of Balarama,\\nand the Ramayana\\'s account of the vanara king Vali defeating Ravana, the king of Lanka, in a wrestling contest.\\nAlso, there are stories describing Krishna report that he was sometimes engaged in wrestling matches where he\\nused knee strikes to the chest, punches to the head, hair pulling, and strangleholds (Green & Svinth, 2010).\\nPersian poet Hakim Abol-Ghasem Ferdowsi Toosi (c.977 and 1010 A.D.) left us the work of central importance\\nin Persian culture, also regarded as a literary masterpiece and the classics of the world, The Shahnameh or Shah-\\nnama, in translation \"The Book of Kings\". The Shahnameh is a long epic poem consisting of some 60,000 verses\\n(Davis, 2006). In it the poet immortalizes the ancient legendary kings and heroes of Iran from the creation of the\\nworld until the Islamic conquest of Persia in the 7th century. In the epic tale, Suhrab and his father Rustam, the\\npreeminent protagonist of the Shahnama, have never met. Suhrab was in perpetual search of his father, whom he\\nknew to be Rustam, but whose face he did not know. When they finally do meet, it was on the war battlefield\\nbetween Iran and Turan, neither knew that they were father and son. As no one else dared to fight Rostam,\\nSohrab, known as the best young fighter of Turan army, was sent to wrestle with the legendary Persian hero. His\\nplan was to attack Iran, install Rustam on the Iranian throne and then they would attack Turan and together rule\\nthe world. They started to wrestle. After the first day of battle, Suhrab\\'s taste of victory and boast was contrasted\\nwith Rustam\\'s dread of possible defeat. For him to withdraw from battle was unthinkable; on the other, to\\ncontinue in battle meant possible defeat and therefore lost of his reputation before two watching armies, which\\nwas also unthinkable. On the battle field, without stating the reason, Sohrab told his rival that he would not fight\\nagainst Rostam. Thus Rostam did not reveal his name. After a very long and heavy wrestle, Rostam felt weak and\\nafraid to spoil his reputation, so he stabbed his son in the heart. Tahmina, who came to the field to keep them from\\nbloodshed, was too late and Sohrab died on his mourning father\\'s hands (Arnold & Trent, 2005).\\n\\n52\\n\\x0c',\n",

In this article,\\nthe authors will bring an overview of ancient wrestling combats recorded in many different literary works and\\nlegends from all over the world. Some of the literary works and legends are over thousand years old. As it is\\nimpossible, for this stage of the study, to list all the literary works from all over the world in which we can read\\nabout the wrestling combat, we will present the chosen literary texts in a chronological order as they appear in\\ntoday\\'s literature from different cultures. In this way we will try to confirm hypothesis that wrestling, through art,\\nconnects different places and periods of time, as well as cultural and religious differences.\\n\\nWeaponless combat sports have existed since prehistoric times. Some of the earliest accounts of wrestling can be\\nfound in wrestling mythology (F. P. Miller, Vandome, & John, 2010b), therefore we are not surprised that the\\ndescriptions of the wrestling competitions can be found in the early stages of literacy. As it has been, for\\nthousands of years, the most popular combat sport, the strength and heroism of the ancient heroes and their\\nmemorable fights and competitions have been sung in many different earliest cultures (Mesopotamia, Egyptian,\\nGreek, etc.) and their literary texts such as epics, epopees, essays, novels, etc. Many of those texts still live today\\nwritten in the language of the time, never being transcribed into today’s writing. Today we know for sure that\\nwrestling is one of the oldest forms of combat with references to it as early as the Iliad, in which Homer recounts\\nthe Trojan War in the 13th or 12th century B.C. The origins of wrestling can be traced back 15,000 years through\\ncave drawings in France. Babylonian and Egyptian reliefs depict wrestlers using most of the holds known to the\\npresent-day sport. Wrestling was a big part of ancient Greek literature, too. Wrestling competitions, brutal in\\nmany aspects, were the number one sport of the Olympic Games. The ancient Romans adopted the sport from the\\nGreeks wrestling eliminating much of its brutality. During the Middle Ages (fifth century to fifteenth century)\\nwrestling still remained popular. It even enjoyed the patronage of many royal families, including those of\\nEngland, France, and Japan.\\n\\n2. An overview of the early epics with references to wrestling combats\\n\\nThe first epic in which we can read about the wrestling combat is the Epic of Gilgamesh, the earliest known\\nworks of literature today. Scholars believe that it originates as a series of Sumerian legends and poems about a\\nprotagonist of the story, Gilgamesh, the king of Uric, which were, later on, fashioned into a longer Akkadian epic.\\nThe epic became well known thanks to its many themes, plot elements, and characters that can be found in the\\nHebrew Bible in two places - in the stories of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (both stories involve a\\nserpent), as well as in the story of Noah (A. R. George, 2003). Although today we can read a revised version\\nbased on newly discovered and published information, the epic is still not complete (A. George, 2003).\\n\\nThis literary work of art tells a story about a relationship between Gilgamesh and his close male companion,\\nEnkidu. According to the story, Gilgamesh was one-third man and two-thirds god. On the one hand he was very\\nwise, strong and handsome but, on the other hand, he was a very cruel ruler who oppressed the citizens, tortured\\nhis aliens, and raped women. At one point Gods decided to make him an equal opponent. They created a primitive\\nman, Enkidu, covered with hair, who lived in the wild with animals. When the shepard trapper first found him he\\nbrought him a template prostitute, Shamhat, in order to do the first step in his civilization so he could be taken to\\ntown. Gilgamesh and Enkidu met in Uruk at a wedding where Gilgamesh attempted to visit the wedding chamber.\\nEnkidu blocked his way and they immediately started wrestling. The wrestling fight lasted all night, and when the\\nmorning came they became friends. Later on Gilgamesh and Enkidu fought in many dangerous quests that\\nincurred the displeasure of the gods. In their final fight together they killed the Bull of Heaven sent by the goddess\\nIshtar. The result was disastrous. Gods decided to kill one of the heroes, Enkidu. Gilgamesh distressed and\\nswallowed with sadness took a long and perilous journey to meet the immortal flood hero, Utnapishtim.\\nEventually, Gigamesh got killed in that journey.\\n\\nFurthermore, Iliad and Odyssey is one of the most important epics of the 8\" century B.C. The main problem is\\nthat we still do not know anything about its author, Homer. He may have lived around 800 B.C. or somewhat\\nearlier or later. One common legend about him was that he was blind. That story leans on the hypothesis that\\nDemodokos, a blind poet in Odyssey, is the incarnation of Homer himself. Beyond this, there is no solid\\ninformation. In his epics Homer speaks about semi-mythical events that happened between 1200 B.C. and 800\\nB.C.\\n\\n50\\n\\x0c',\n",

For their analysis, the authors have chosen ten texts\\nfrom the Mesopotamian to Middle ages literature. Yet for all these challenges, the authors believe that this study\\nof literary representation of wrestling was worthwhile because it provided us insight into the ways which\\nliterature and sport were always connected.\\nKey words: literature; sport; wrestling\\n1. Introduction: Culture and play — the entire lifestyle of a society\\nUmbero Eco once wrote ’’Sport is Man, Sport is Society” wishing to emphasize that sport represents a central\\ncultural place in the mankind civilization (Eco, 1994). Ethimologically, the word sport comes from the Latin word\\ndeporto (deportare), i.e. to carry around, to deliver, and to convey. Referring to Eco’s words, sport and physical\\nactivities can be traced to the beginnings of recorded history i.e. from the days when people organized fests and\\nvarious games. In those days sport was not an institutionalized type of a game, but it was a part of everyday life.\\nOr as Kokovic explains: ’’Sport was workers’ game, ludic and magical lifestyle of working class people,\\n“qualified curs’ whose aim was to prepare people for certain activities such as hunting, war, etc.’’ (Kokovic,\\n1969). Two things led to a conclusion about the connection of sport and culture (Osmond & Phillips, 2011). On\\nthe one hand, fast growth of all kinds of sport led to a conclusion that sport was slowly becoming mass\\nphenomenon, whether it was just concerning spectators or active participants. On the other hand, faster\\ndevelopment of science and fields dealing with sport have been trying to explain the core and the function of sport\\nin socio-cultural changes that have led to higher interest in sport.\\nWhen we say culture we immediately think about literature, art, painting, music, etc. Professor Huizing, from the\\nLajden University, explained culture in a very picturesque way. He said the following: ’’in the process of\\ndevelopment, every big form of collective life there is, primarily active and fertile [...] was born in a play, and\\ncontinues to live in a form of a play. Wisdom and science were born from sacred competition games. Law was\\nborn from society play. Armed fight rules, and aristocracy convention lifestyle were also based on various forms\\nof play. In a word, in its beginning phases culture was played. Culture is born from a play as a living fruit being\\ncut of the mother plant, it develops in a play and as a play’’(Huizinga, 2003). Therefore, according to the\\nprofessor’s words culture emerges from the play, i.e. play is the factor and the picture of every culture. Or as\\nHaralambos and Holborn claim that culture is the entire lifestyle of a certain society (Haralambos & Holborn,\\n2008).\\n\\n49\\n\\x0c',\n",
              " \"International Journal of Humanities and Social Science Vol. 3 No. 5; March 2013\\nVision of Saint Perpetua — Martyr from Carthage, offers a very significant wrestling match between good and\\nevil. Vibija Perpetua is a 22-year-old Cristian from noble Cartage family (Roman province of Africa). In the\\nmorning of the 7th March 203, because of her religious convictions, she was executed in arena with other martyrs\\n(Barker, 2010). Saturus companion of Perpetua recorded their own visions. Her last vision was:\\n\\nOn the eve of the martyrdom Perpetua has yet another vision: she sees herself, as a male athlete\\n\\nanointed with oil, wrestling and overcoming an immense Egyptian in the arena, - a symbol of the\\n\\ndevil (Shaw, 1993).\\nAnother example of sport being a part of a literary work can be found in the Old English heroic epic poem,\\nBeowulf. Beowulf consists of 3182 alliterative long lines, and is often cited as one of the most important works of\\nAnglo-Saxon literature. The name of the poet who assembled from tradition the materials of this story and put\\nthem in their final form is still unknown to us. Nobody knows for certain when the poem was first composed. It is\\nbelieved that the work was composed between the 8th (Hieatt & Hieatt, 1988; Tolkien, 1974) and the early 11th\\ncentury (Kiernan, 1997). In more than 3,000 lines long, Beowulf, a classic tale of the triumph of good over evil,\\nrelates the exploits of its eponymous hero neatly into three acts i.e. three successive battles - with a monster,\\nnamed Grendel, with Grendel’s revengeful mother, and with a dragon which was guarding a hoard of treasure.\\nThe poem opens in Denmark. Grendel, a troll-like monster, was terrorizing the kingdom. The Geatish prince\\nBeowulf heard of his neighbors’ plight, and sailed to their aid with a band of warriors (sec I-IT). Beowulf and his\\nmen spent the night in Heorot. Beowulf bore no weapon as Grendel was immune to human weapons. After they\\nfell asleep, Grendel entered the hall and attacked, devouring one of Beowulf's men. Then he clenched Grendel's\\nhand. The two wrestled until it seemed as though the hall might collapse. Finally, in a wild wrestling match\\nBeowulf tore Grendel's arm from his body (III-XID) at the shoulder and Grendel ran to his home in the marshes to\\ndie. Victorious, Beowulf went home to Geatland in Sweden and later became king of the Geats.\\nVery short, but nevertheless less important story comes from Japan. Kojiki, the oldest extant chronicle in Japan\\nwhich dates from the early 8th century (Chamberlain, 2008), is a collection of myths concerning the origin of the\\nfour home islands of Japan, and the Kami. According to the story Japanese Emperor Temmu, during the 7th\\ncentury, set about to correct inconsistencies within the national history contained in the various Teiki and Kyiji\\ncirculating with the nobles. He sorted through them and commanded Heido-no-Are to memorize them all. He was\\nrenowned for his intelligence and brightness. Later, Empress Gemmei ordered O no Yasumaro to compile the\\nKojiki based on what Are had memorized. This was completed in 712. What is of a particular interest for this\\nstudy is a story that describes two Japanese gods, Takemikazuchi and Takeminekata. As the Japanese coast was\\nso beautiful each of the two gods wanted it for themselves. They made an agreement. One who wins in a\\nwrestling match gets to rule over that part of a land. They wrestled at the Izumo coast. The winner set his own\\ndeputy to rule that area. That deputy was the future Japanese emperor.\\nThe last notable written document that we took as an example of the connection between sport and literature dates\\nfrom the 12th century. It tells the story about Gogmagog, a legendary giant of such prodigious strength in British\\nfolklore, who, to the 12th Century Historia Regum Britanniae, was a giant inhabitant of Albion thrown off a cliff\\nduring a wrestling match with Corineus, a companion of Brutus of Troy (F. P. Miller, Vandome, & John, 2010a;\\nMonmouth & Faletra, 2007). According to Geoffrey of Monmouth's account when Brutus was holding a feast\\nwith his companions in Totnes some twenty giants led by Goémagot descended on the company who made a\\ndreadful slaughter. At last the giants were routed and slain except for Goémagot who was captured so that\\nCorineus could wrestle with him. At the beginning of the encounter, Corineus and the giant, standing, front to\\nfront, held each other strongly in their arms, and panted aloud for breath, but Goémagot presently grasping\\nCorineus with all his might, breaking three of his ribs, two on his right side and one on his left. At which\\nCorineus, highly enraged, roused up his whole strength, and snatching him upon his shoulders, ran with him, as\\nfast as the weight would allow him, to the next shore, and there getting upon the top of a high rock, hurled down\\nthe savage monster into the sea; where falling on the sides of craggy rocks, he was torn to pieces, and colored the\\nwaves with his blood. The place where he fell, taking its name from the giant's fall, was, and still is, called Lam\\nGoémagot, that is, Goémagot's Leap, to this day (Evans, 2008).\\n\\n53\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Discussion\\n\\nIt is an interesting fact that, in ancient times, athletes anointed their bodies with oil as Perpetua saw in her vision\\n(Christoph, 1979). During the Ancient Greek Olympic games wrestlers first anointed their bodies with olive oil\\nthen they dusted them with powder to make them easier to grasp. There is a variant of oil wrestling in the modern\\nTurkey, called Kirkpinar. National Turkish wrestling is a very old sport so it is possible that it may be the west-\\nAnatolian variant of Greek wrestling in ancient times (C. Miller, 2004). When the Romans conquered the Greeks,\\nthey absorbed Greek wrestling and competitions that took place in the Roman Arena just as Perpetua saw in her\\nvision. Wrestling combats took place along with more brutal and more popular gladiatorial combats and other\\nusual arena activity. Even the immense Egyptian, Perpetuas opponent, is a logical choice. In ancient Egyptian\\nculture wrestling was extremely popular. Wrestling motif was common in Egyptian literary and material culture\\n(Poliakoff, 1987). To overcome a Nubijan wrestling champion, during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaton-a (1353 -\\n1336 B.C.), was a great honor (Carroll, 1988). We can assume that in the ancient Rome (1500 years after)\\napproximately the same honor was to overcome the Egyptian wrestling champion.\\n\\nIt is interesting how we can connect Perpetua’s vision with the wrestling history and wrestling matches described\\nby Homer (Cowper & Johnson, 1791). All other mentioned literary works do not pay too much attention on\\nwrestling details, but they rather talk about the strength of the heroes, intensity of the battle and/or about the\\nduration of the battle. For example, we read about Gilgamesh and Enkidu holding each other like bulls shattering\\nthe doorpost. Also, during the Corineus and Goémagot's fight was so loud and fearful that all the people around\\nthem thought there must have been an earthquake somewhere. Today, matches between equal opponents can also\\nlast very long. Let us remember the match held during the Olympic Games in Sweden 1912. It was a match\\nbetween Martin Klein representing from Russia and Alfred Asikainen representing Finland. The match lasted 11\\nhours and 40 minutes. It is the longest match in the modern wrestling history. Yudhisthira and Bheema wrestled\\nfor 27 days, Rustam and Sohraba wrestled for 2 days, Jacob and Angel wrestled until dawn, while Ajax and\\nOdyssey wrestled in a long and exhausting match.\\n\\nIn the considered literary texts all the main characters win their duels, except the Odyssey. Rustam, Bheema,\\nKri§na and Corineus solve the fight by killing the opponent; Bheema even pulls apart the opponent's body into\\ntwo. Beowulf does not kill Grandel but he pulls apart Grendel's arm from his body. Even Angel hurts Jacob's\\nthigh. In ancient times, wrestling, as the most popular sport, had lot of forms. Malla-yudha South Asian form of\\ncombat-wrestling was very brutal. In ancient China the Shuai jiao was a form of folk wrestling, and Jiao li was a\\nform of a very brutal match of Shuai jiao which supplemented throwing techniques with strikes, blocks and joint\\nlocks. Wrestling was also a part of ancient Greek Pankracion (combination of wrestling and boxing) which was a\\nbrutal martial art with recorded deaths (Galen & Singer, 1997; Nomikos, Nomikos, Mavrogenis, &\\nPapagelopoulos, 2008; Poliakoff, 1987).\\n\\nThere are also different forms of wrestling which are based on rules which forbid brutality and potentially\\ndangerous grips. We find the examples of such matches in literary texts. For examples, Homer describes a hero\\novercoming his opponent by the rules, while in the Japanese fight of the gods and Gilgamesh the match is also\\nwon by the surrender of the opponent. In ancient Greek wrestling fights and also wrestling trainings were very\\npainful and sometimes very brutal. But as the audience knew the rules very well they preferred a fair fight. Judges\\nand even audience influenced on regularity of the wrestling fights in Homer's Greece (Nomikos, et al., 2008;\\nPoliakoff, 1987). So the outcome of the fights which he described is quite logical.\\n\\nIn all epic fights we expect the fair fight from the main hero; these works often carry an educational message to\\nthe reader, but not in all these battles. After all night of wrestling Angel injured Jacob to end the fight. When\\nRostam realized that he could lose the fight and his honor he stabs the dagger in Sohrabas heart. These endings do\\nnot coincide with modern moral principles but we must take into consideration the time and conditions when\\nthese works are written as well as plot of the tale. The heroes of these epic fights had different motives. Odyssey\\nfights to win the Achilles's armor and weapon, KriSna, Jarasindha and Japanese gods wrestle for land, Corineus\\nand Beowulf wrestle to save their people from monstrous terror. Atlanta wrestles just to overcome the opponent,\\nwhile Gilgamesh ends the fight with epic friendship. Even with interesting wrestling details, Perpetua's fight is a\\npure symbolic one. In her struggle she overcomes the evil and prepares herself for martyrdom in the Roman arena.\\nAs we can conclude, differences caused by the temporal, geographic, cultural and religious distances have been\\nconnecting wrestling through history from the early beginnings of the humankind.\\n\\n54\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              " \"International Journal of Humanities and Social Science Vol. 3 No. 5; March 2013\\nTwo wrestling matches, the first between a mythological Greek hero Ajax and Odyssey and the second between\\nPeleus and Atlanta, epic are of our particular interest. When Achiles was killed, Ajax and Odyssey brought his\\nbody and weapons into a camp. At the funeral ceremony, held in honor of the deceased hero, the sport events\\nwere held. Goddess Thetis, mother of Achilles, decided that who won in a wrestling match may take with him\\nAchilles’ armor and weapon. Ajax and Odyssey, drawn by the reword, decided to fight. After a long and\\nexhausting match there was no winner. Nestor suggested that the Trojans prisoners, who witnessed the match,\\nshould decide on who the winner should be. They decided that it should be Odyssey. Furious Ajax suddenly lost\\nhis common sense. He took out his sward and slaughtered all the cattle standing in front of the camp thinking it\\nwere the enemies. Seeing what he had done, he took his own life.\\nThere is, in addition, another wrestling combat recorded in the same epics. This story concerns Peleus, Thetis's\\nhusband, and Achilles’ father. According to Apollodorus, Greek scholar and grammarian (Smith, 1880), at the\\nfuneral games honoring Pelias, Atlanta entered the wrestling contests. Here she gained more fame by scoring a\\nvictory over Peleus.\\nAnother significant wrestling combat can be traced in The Bible. Today we know that the Bible, referring to any\\none of the collections of the primary religious texts of Judaism and Christianity, was written between 1513 B.C.\\nand 98 A.D. In it one wrestling match has been in the focus of many discussions between the Muslims, on one\\nside, and the Christians and the Jew, on the other. Jacob wrestling with the Angel is a biblical story commonly\\ndepicted in art. The story appears in the Chapter 32 of Genesis, and in the Chapter 12 of the Book of Hosea.\\nDepending on the source text, the being with which Jacob wrestled is variously described. Once that being is an\\nangel, once a man, and sometimes even God. However, the event occurred during Jacob's journey back to Canaan.\\nHe rose up that night, and took his two wives, two women servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford\\nJabbok. After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. Jacob was left alone.\\nThat night he wrestled with a man until the breaking of the day. When the man saw that he could not overpower\\nhim, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.\\nThe man asked Jacob to let him down but Jacob refused to give in and pleaded for a blessing from his opponent.\\nThe man asked him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he answered. Then the man said, “Your name will no longer\\nbe Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.” Jacob said,\\n“Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there. So Jacob\\ncalled the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.” And as he\\npassed over Peniel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. Therefore to this day the children of Israel\\ndo not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the\\ntendon (Publishers, 2008).\\nFor well over 1,000 years, sacred stories and heroic epics have also been a part of the Hinduism mythology\\n(Dowson, 1870). It is interesting to mention that the history of sports in India dates back to the ancient times with\\nreferences found in the Vedas and Indus Valley Civilization. In Villas Mani Majra, Tiruvedacharya describes\\nmany fascinating games (Bloomfield & Sirya, 1964), namely, archery, equitation, hammer-throwing and chariot-\\nracing. In Manas Olhas (1135 A.D.), Someshwar writes about bhrashram (weight-lifting), bhramanshram\\n(walking) and also about Mall-Stambha wrestling (Rao).\\nIn addition, the Vedas being a large body of texts, composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest\\nlayer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, contain an anecdote on the wrestling match\\n(Dallapiccola, 2002). Krishna, the central figure of Hinduism, is traditionally attributed the authorship of the\\nBhagavad Gita, also more simply known as Gita. Gita is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the ancient\\nSanskrit epic, the Mahabharata, but is frequently treated as a freestanding text, and in particular, as an Upanishad\\nin its own right, one of the several books that constitute general Vedic tradition. Among its eighteen chapters,\\nchapter forty-four brings the wrestling match between Krisna and Kamsa. Kamsa or Kansa was the brother of\\nDevaki, and ruler of the Vrishni kingdom. His father was King Ugrasena and his mother was Queen Padmavati.\\nHowever, upon the advice of his personal confidante, Banasura, Kamsa decided to overthrow his father and install\\nhimself as the King of Mathura. Kamsa was told in a prophecy that the eighth child of Devaki would kill him one\\nday. As he did not want to kill Devaki he decided to imprison both Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva. In the\\nconfines of the prison, Devaki repeatedly conceived, and an enraged Kamsa murdered the first six children. The\\nseventh child, Balarama, was saved when he was moved to Rohini's womb.\\n\\n51\\n\\x0c\"]"

        "Interview With ‘Mogi’ and ‘Minga’\n",
        "Mogi: “My brothers were all wrestlers, and they had all of their medals up on the wall. As a kid, I would put them on, and I wanted medals of my own. When I was in fifth grade, 1999 or 1998, my brother took me to a wrestling club, and I saw the kids doing rolls and exercise on their head and I went home and tried it on the carpet. For some reason, it was a year until I got to go. So, I think it grew on me. I was super motivated. I joined in September, and in February had my first small district tournament. I weighed 29 kg. I won third place. In May, I went to a tournament and won second place. When I was training, I was thinking there was another kid in Japan or someplace training harder than me. I was motivating myself to beat my imaginary opponent. I was very thin, physically weak, and often sick as a kid. But I was also very fast and agile. In addition to wrestling, I also played basketball. I was on the team even though I was the smallest. So I was doing two trainings a day, basketball and wrestling.” \n",
        "Minga: “My uncle, Bumbayar, is a good national wrestler, a seven-round winner in Naadam, so he got the title of elephant. He was the inspiration for me when I was a kid. As a family we would get together and watch his tournaments and I wanted to be like him. I had two brothers, and I would wrestle with them and with my cousins. I grew up in Uvs Province where the best wrestlers come from. I am from Tes soum which is probably the most wrestling-dominant soum in the country. Since Naadam records have been kept, Tes has won 44 times, the second highest soum winning just nine. Everybody wrestled there. If you go there and just grab someone off the street, they will wrestle you.” \n",
        "Minga: “In 1997, our family moved to Ulaanbaatar for education. I was in third grade. I joined a wrestling club for a year, but the coach was sent to Japan for school. During that year I won some medals and it was a nice feeling, but then I had no place to train until Arslan Club was formed. They had a big tryout, where we had to do pushups, sit-ups, running, and pullups to compete for a space on the team. I got in. John and Ben Peterson, world title winners and Olympic gold medalists from the 1970s, organized this cadet international tournament, in the 1990s, which ran until a few years ago, called Athletes in Action. Me and Mogi competed and made it to the finals. I think Mogi won. We were about 12 years old, and Mogi went to Russia for the finals. Mogi also won an international tournament in Bulgaria when he was about 14. “\n",
        "Minga: “Our club had an invitational tournament with over 400 cadet kids competing in eight or ten weight classes. The Peterson tournaments were huge, he brought kids from the United States and athletes, cadets from Inner Mongolia and Russia. Bishop Lynch, from Texas, coached by Kenny Munday. Luke Silver Ashmore’s brothers all went to division one schools with a scholarship. They all came to Mongolia to wrestle in this tournament. These tournaments were international freestyle, but in the US, you have to learn folkstyle or scholastic-style wrestling. It is a bit different, and the scoring is different, but at the end of the day it was all wrestling.” \n",
        "Minga: “Our coach had started a club where we wrestled. World Cup top-ten teams did dual matches against each other, and in 2003, it took place in Madison Square Garden, New York City. We went to compete, and our coach was part of the staff for the event. The Mongolian national team was hosted by Mike Dipiano Sr., athletic director of St. Benedict’s in New Jersey, and Mike Dipiano Jr. was the head of wrestling. They hosted our team, and we went over to St. Benedict’s to train. Our coach made friends with the American coaches. The American coach said ‘If you want to send a kid to US to wrestle and study, we would take one.’ Mogi was chosen, and started in the spring semester, January 2004. He was 13 years old, alone in New Jersey. His English was better than mine. I knew English from school, but I didn’t really speak it.”  \n",
        "Mogi: “One of our older teammates was on the international team, and they messed up the workout slot times at Madison Square Garden so we didn’t have a slot. So someone arranged for us to train in New Jersey and that is how we wound up at St. Dominic’s Prep, by accident. It was my first time staying away from home. I did well in school. But I had no friends and I didn’t know anyone.” \n",
        "Minga: “Mogi came back that summer and I was offered a chance to go back to school with him. I started September 2004 as a junior with Mogi, and Bagana came in August 2005 as a sophomore.” \n",
        "Mogi: “That year, I became All-American. I was a three-time high school All-American and Minga was a two-times All-American. Minga’s record was 49 and 2 in senior year, but in junior year, he lost a lot of matches because he didn’t know how to escape from bottom which is required in folkstyle wrestling, but not freestyle. In freestyle you just stay down and wait for the ref to do a reset. In the US, they have both international and American rules.” \n",
        "Minga: “The biggest wrestling tournament in the world is Fargo, North Dakota, cadet national championships, with 30 mats and three days. And that one is [international] freestyle. [After Fargo] they collect the best wrestlers from US and form a dream team. Mogi got picked for that, and then they went to go wrestle against all of the state teams.” \n",
        "Together, the two wrestlers amassed only three losses in their final year of high school with a record final year 59 and 2 and 49 and 1 respectively. Mogi finished high school with a record of 118-21, for grades ten to twelve.\n",
        "One difference between wrestling in the United States and Mongolia identified by all of the interview subjects was that in the US they had the opportunity to compete more frequently. Minga wrestled in American high school for two years and had over 100 matches. He said: “If we had stayed in Mongolia we couldn’t have done that. There are only five or six tournaments per year and no dual matches.”\n",
        "Mogi: “[In Mongolia] there is no matching system, just a lottery. When you weigh-in, you draw a number, and you could get matched with anyone, the best guy or worst guy.” \n",
        "Minga: “I think our background influences everything we do, whether it’s judo or wrestling or boxing. But a big part of our culture is wrestling. We are known as a wrestling nation. Our national sport is wrestling. We go on the grass and wrestle for the take down, and it is a unique sport on its own, unique agility types of technique.” \n",
        "Minga: “There are little guys winning against these huge guys. They know how to execute the techniques and how to train. There are a lot of techniques that we grew up with like trips and knee taps that I used in my freestyle. These are unique techniques that people don’t know in other sports or freestyle, and they can’t see it coming. A lot of the techniques that I hit these kids with, I was confident that I could score with it, but they couldn’t see it coming. Mongolian wrestling is so unique. Good wrestlers come from other countries and can’t win in it. No chance.” \n",
        "Minga: “I grew up in a place where you have no choice but to learn wrestling. You go out riding your horse or herding sheep. You wrestle the other boy who is herding his sheep. Or we do horse racing.”\n",
        "Minga: “We were both All-Americans, and universities were showing interest in us. High school season ends in February. The college championship was in March, and it was held in New Jersey. The team from St. John’s University came to train at our school, St Benedict’s Prep. They only had five guys, so they had an odd man, so they asked me to join in and help him train. I wrestled him and I scored on him, and the coach was impressed. And the same happened for Mogi. The coach asked us where we were from and so on. Our headmaster graduated from St. John’s University, and that’s why they were there. Both are Benedictine schools. St. John’s coach, Brandon Novack, said: ‘After I go back, I will send you an application and let’s see what we can do.’ When we had first arrived at St. Benedict’s the wrestling coach asked us if we wanted to go to college. We said we planned to. He said, ‘If you do everything I say, you’ll make it.’ Coach Novack sent us the application. That part was easy. We had very good grades, because in Mongolia, science, math, and physics were ahead of what we learned in the US. We were mediocre in History and English, but our overall GPA was good. Now the problem was the scholarship. Division 3 didn’t offer scholarships. But Coach Novack wanted to help us, and we had no other options. We told him, ‘Even if we had to pay $5,000 a year, we can’t do it.’ So, they gave us 20% university scholarship for being Mongolian and 30% for good grades and then some private donors got together and paid the remaining 50%. We didn’t even make a trip or make a visit to see the campus. We just went back to Mongolia for the summer and started school in September in St. John’s. And we were lucky. Out-of-state tuition should be double and foreign should be triple.”\n",

        "Mogi: “We used to have the Russian school system which was 10 years. and Minga might be the last year before they changed to 11, and then quickly to 12 years. That meant, we were already high school graduates in Mongolia, including math and science... English and History ate up most of my study time, because I had to translate everything. I had a huge Mongolian-English dictionary, and had to use it so many times that, by the end of the year, the right bottom corner was missing. You couldn’t just go out and buy one of those in New Jersey. It was the one thing I brought from Mongolia. My suitcase was empty except for the dictionary. The teachers allowed us to use the dictionary in school and exams.”\n",
        "Minga: “We made friends with the wresting team so quickly. The wrestling family made our stay so much better. My English was not as good as Mogi’s, but he was right by my side. He helped me communicate with people and have a good conversation, at a friends’ level. When we wrestled, that was ok, our teammates used to take us home to stay with their families, and go to the mall and shopping. Our coaches would also sometimes take us home. St. Benedict’s has a dorm with capacity for 60 kids. They have house parents who work and live in the dormitory, to take care of the kids. And the monks would come from the monastery to help us with our homework and with our tutoring. If you wanted to succeed, the support was there for you. You just had to put in the effort. The teachers were understanding too. Sometimes they would say ‘fifty pages for everyone’ but only ten for me. It would take the American students an hour, but for me it might take three or four. Eventually, though, they had me on the same level as them.” \n",
        "Mogi: “Catholic education is great. The best thing was the students run everything. Student workers ran the library cafeteria… St. Benedict’s is a different type of set-up. It’s even different from other Catholic schools. It is becoming a model and was featured on TV. It focuses on athletics, leadership, and academics. It was very strict in the way that they beat the culture in, all about brotherhood and community building. Community building was so important for the school. To stop racism, the school focused a lot on black children. It was a special school, very strict. You had to play two sports per year, spring and fall. We wrestled and the other season we did cross-country, because we wanted to do something that would help us with wrestling. You had to wear a tie and shoes. You would be sent back home if you didn’t have your tie. Admissions were mostly need-based and run by the donors and alumni. The school won seven out of ten national championships. Lots of our classmates went on to play college sports or pro sports. They produced basketball, soccer, and wrestling stars. The school is famous for basketball. They have a lot of brotherhood and leadership and hiking in the mountains and staying overnight in the woods.”\n",
        "Mogi: “I think this plan should be implemented everywhere in the world, especially the rich schools here in Mongolia. I went back as a science and math teacher after I graduated college. It made us so busy and we were dealing with cultural difference, but now we both speak great English because we had to do activities and sports and all of that. I tell Mongolian young people who are going overseas to join clubs, it is quicker to get access to the community and friends. The headmaster told us that success is when preparation meets opportunity. That was us. We had the wrestling and academic skills then we met the opportunity, and we were ready for it. Going to college was the dream, and we made it. In college we had no problem with reading. And we were like halfway cultured.” \n",
        "Minga: “My mom called one time and asked if I was missing home. I said ‘I am home. I’m in USA.’ That’s how quickly you adapt as a kid, sucking it in like a sponge. When we moved from high school to college I had to lift more weights, but Mogi didn’t. He was very technical. He had the record for the most wins as a freshman. Going to big tournaments as a freshman, I was still a kid, but the guys were grown men. That’s why I started lifting weights and drinking protein.” \n",
        "Mogi majored in physics. Minga majored in math and minored in business.\n",
        "Minga: “Junior year was hard. The upper-level classes were a lot harder. In years 1 and 2, you just had to sit down in the evening and do your work. In years 3 and 4, you needed some tutoring and math club. In lower divisions, there were numbers in math class. In years 3 and 4, there were no numbers. Our original goal was to get educated. So we asked ‘What’s the hardest major?’ and they said ‘Computer Science.’ And they asked me to write a program, but I didn’t know what that was.” \n",
        "Minga: “I think wrestlers tend to be more academic and take harder majors, but in division one they take physical education or nutrition and only 12 credits per semester and go to school in summer.” \n",
        "Mogi graduated St. John’s in 2010, returning to Mongolia with a bachelor’s degree. Minga graduated in 2011 with a collegiate record of 88-19, winning the national championships three times. In his senior season, he went 27-1, earning him the NCAA Championships’ Outstanding Wrestler Award and the D3wrestle.com National Wrestler of the Year Award. After returning to Mongolia, he finished first at the Tulgat Open in 2011 and second at the 2012 Mongolian Open. \n",
        "Both were All-Americans, Minga winning three All-Americans. In his final year of high school, Minga broke the school record by winning three national titles. Seven days after graduation, Minga was back in Mongolia. \n",
        "Minga: “I went back to Mongolia, got a job, but kept active training because it’d been part of my life since I was very young. I kept training at 66kg, working with the national team in Mongolia, but I could beat the [top three] guys easily. It was June, and I had just finished the season in March, so I was pretty sharp still. My coach just came back from Taiwan where he was head coach for two years and said ‘Next year is the Olympics,’ 2012, London. ‘What do you think?’ So I got thinking about that. We went to Turkey to watch the Olympic qualifiers, and I was training and helping guys cut weight. I got photos with Jordan Burroughs and some others. Then we had the Mongolia Open competition, and I made it to the finals, and lost to a Mongolian. The federation sent me to the Asian Championships. I made it to finals, and lost.” \n",
        "Minga did not make it to the Olympics, but he made it to the qualifiers.\n",
        "Mogi: “Sports nutrition and professional resistance training specific to a sport is new to Mongolia. Oftentimes, teams that have more funding will be able to do something like that or pay for fitness gym memberships. However, the lifting is done usually under instruction of wrestling coaches. I’m not sure if it has changed or not since I’ve been away from freestyle wrestling, due to all the bullshit and in-fighting... The BJJ Association is much better in that sense, not fighting with each other. Few sports teams have a dedicated personal strength trainer due to lack of funds and lack of professionals capable of filling the role. Mongolian traditional wrestlers have massive thighs, but that’s not always true for freestyle, with the exception of heavier weights.” \n",
        "Mogi: “I don’t think any Mongolian would be able to just walk in and dominate a folkstyle tournament in the US, unless your freestyle is very good and you dominate from neutral position by multiple takedowns, which was my case in high school and also my weak spot because I never trained escaping. Had I learnt escaping in high school, my record would be much higher, and I’d have been a much tougher opponent. I was able to master the escaping from bottom in folkstyle in junior year in college because my teammate, who was a year older and weight class above me gave me hell on top and I was pissed off not being able to escape. I give credit to my teammates in college. Had I learnt how to escape, back in high school, and if I’d learnt how important it is to do strength training, my wrestling career would have been very different, winning the national prep would have been within reach, because I was very technical, but a weak wrestler.” \n",
        "Mogi: “One advantage I had over the American kids or college guys was being able to use my foot as part of my takedown in my pocket. Also, my confidence in wrestling from over and under position, which are common skills in Mongolian traditional wrestling and judo. Anyone who has a good freestyle wrestling background can be successful with some minor adjustments and escape technique in folkstyle.” \n",
        "Researcher: “That is exactly what I say when I wrestle here. In China, one of my best training mates was not from the wrestling team, he was from the judo team and now he is signed with UFC China. But he always did that foot sweep. Then I came to Mongolia and I see so many different kinds of foot sweeps. Western wrestlers, Americans, don’t usually know those techniques very well.” \n",
        "Researcher: “In Mongolia, I haven’t actually seen wrestlers or MMA fighters doing physical training. They do a long hard warm up, which includes exercises, but I haven’t seen them do weightlifting days or conditioning days. In fact, at one team, the coach asked me to take the guys on weightlifting. So, I was wondering, is the strength in the countryside just natural from hard work and eating meat and maybe the guys don’t do any strength training? And did that carry over to the city? I trained with the sambo team at the sports center, just one day, but they actually do weights like three to five times a week. Maybe the wrestlers at that level do the same. But the guys at the physical education college and at the high schools, I have not seen them lifting weights or doing conditioning.” \n",
        "Researcher: “I asked you about the national wrestling and if it thins out the talent for freestyle and it seems like you agree that at the high end, like 120 kg (264 lbs) and up, those guys are mostly doing national wrestling, not freestyle. Hakuho Sho’s father was a six-time Naadam winner and the first Olympic medalist from Mongolia, so clearly some people can do both. You said by doing national wrestling they get immediate recognition. That was the thing in India, too. They have 20 million wrestlers and almost no Olympic medals. Traditional wrestlers also make a lot of money and win pride, so they aren’t that interested in the Olympics.” \n",
        "Mogi: “There are wrestlers who do both, and some do only one or the other. Success in traditional wrestling can result in immediate reputation and improving livelihood, so a lot of the bigger guys focus their effort there. There are quite a few wrestlers who are successful in both and able to capitalize on skills from both styles of wrestling to their advantage, which makes them tougher to beat. However, our heavier freestyle guys are not the best in the world due to a lack of competitors in their weight class, for the reason I mentioned above. A lot of the athletes have a hard time transitioning to real life after their careers ends. I do believe that for one who successfully applies the wrestling mentality in business, success is a matter of time and patience.”\n",

        "Interview With Mendbagana Tovuujav ‘Bagana’\n",
        "In eighth grade, back in Mongolia, Mendbagana Tovuujav “Bagana” got into a street fight. Then two-time world freestyle wrestling finalist Naranbaatar Bayaraa approached him and invited him to wrestling training. Three of Bagana’s brothers and his father wrestled on Mongolia’s national team, so wrestling was already a feature in his family. Bagana took third place in the Mongolian High School Nationals. After training with the Mongolian wrestling team, Bagana was offered a full scholarship to finish high school in the United States. The coach of the Mongolian team had an agreement with St. Dominic’s High School, New Jersey, to send one Mongolian wrestler each year. That year it was Bagana. He wrestled at St. Dominic’s and earned a full scholarship to George Mason University. Bagana finished his senior year at university with a record of 20-3.\n",
        "When he arrived in the United States, he spoke no English. He struggled with the language, but managed to succeed academically. In Mongolia, he had been doing international freestyle wrestling, but in the United States he had to learn folkstyle. He said that having had experience with several styles, including Bökh, gave him a different perspective. \n",
        "Bagana: “Comparing wrestling in the US and Mongolia, a huge differences is the facilities. Every high school, every school in the US, has a perfect gym, better than the Mongolian national team. In the US, at practice, they have Gatorade on the side and they don’t even finish drinking it. They just drink half and throw it away. In Mongolia, we drink Gatorade for Christmas. We don’t even have water in the training hall. No mouth guard, that’s for rich kids and weaklings. You don’t need teeth.” \n",
        "Bagana: “In Mongolia, we have some good coaches, but they don’t teach details. The best part of Mongolian coaches is that Mongolian coaches look at you, see you, and make you find yourself. But the majority of the American coaches I met, they teach you how to do, how to train it, ‘You touch this person. You do this. You stay in your box and you do this or that.’ They are very technical and teach you to do it the same way. They teach everyone to do it the same way. Even telling us, ‘When you do this move, your eyes should be looking this way or that way.’ Mongolian coaches let you be yourself. It’s more based on a feeling that you find yourself. It’s not like everything you have to do, you have to do perfectly. But, in America, they want you to stand here, stand that way, take a breath, head this way, finish like that…every detail they teach you. One hundred kids ‘Do this. Do that. Practice 50 times.’ And the kids do it.”\n",
        "Bagana: “In a way, I think the Mongolian way is right. I think everyone is different. And there could be someone who is tall or skinny, and they do a single or double-leg-takedown differently, but still score. Or, kids with strong arms and a strong back do it differently, and still win. A short, fast guy is different. But if you have a coach who is too tall or long, his idea is different. What if a guy is tall, long, and not muscular, and that coach teaches him a high-crotch. If he teaches high-crotch with lift that has to be for the strong wrestlers. Each wrestler is different, and has to do the technique differently. Some people have good feeling, but need to know how to use their advantage to get the points. The beauty here, in Mongolia, is they make each athlete different.” \n",
        "Bagana: “In America, even the kids they like to talk, and describe detail by detail. But here, it is more natural. They just do it 2,000 or 3,000 times, and then they figure it out. If a person really wants to be a good athlete, an Olympic champion, he just has to figure it out.” \n",
        "Interview With Odgerel Batkhishig \n",
        "Odgerel Batkhishig, wrestling at Campbell University in North Carolina, talked about how transferable Mongolian techniques and wrestling training are for freestyle wrestling. He said that he felt that Mongolian Bökh wrestling, and growing up wrestling in Mongolia, was a huge advantage, but even boys with a solid Mongolian Bökh wrestling background would need to go to the United States young enough to receive training, in order to excel at folkstyle, scholastic-style, and international freestyle. \n",
        "Without being able to grip the clothing, a Mongolian kid trained only in Bökh would be at a disadvantage, he said. Also, he would not know how to fight on the ground or how to pin. He would also need to learn the rules and how to leverage them to win points in matches. This is why Mogi, Minga, and Bagana did so well in the United States. They went young enough to learn and excel at folkstyle wrestling, before competing for a spot on a university team and doing collegiate style wrestling. \n",
        "Odgerel Batkhishig at Northwest Kansas Tech finished 2016-17 with a 44-10 overall record. In 2017, he became a National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) All-American, placing third nationally at heavyweight. At the Southern Conference Championship, he was named the 2018-19 runner-up at heavyweight. He also took runner-up at the Navy Classic. He claimed the 2018 NJCAA National Championship at 285 lbs (129 kg), as well as a second All-American honor, finishing with a two-season record of 86-13 record.\n",

        "It looks like they are wearing Mongolian hats but actually it is because they used to bun up their hair. Some claim these are from 7,000 years ago. From bronz age 4-5000 more accurately. To show that they are males they have a penis although the people weren’t really naked it was just that this is how they showed that it was male.\n",
        "They were wrestling in a circle with people standing around. \n",
        "Some photos look like the people are kicking but we cannot say for sure that this is what we are seeing. It could be a sweep or it could be something else. \n",
        "We know it is wrestling because they don’t have weapons but some people say it looks like boxing but there is no record of Mongolians having done boxing so long ago. Make private parts 3,000 years ago they couldn’t do them in beautiful detail. \n",
        "Some people think the pictures look like ritual dancing but the actual ritual dancing pictures are different. \n",
        "There are pictures with people standing but there must be an interpretation some say it is an audience but it may also be just the other villagers who were not wrestling. There were fingers. \n",

Small people could be children but could b adults far away as a perspective. \n",

        "Some of the paintings are dirt paintings with dirt painted on the rock and it is very dry in the desert so it survives a long time. But the carvings usually survive longer.

        "Him: Most of these artifacts were from a region which is China, Ordos, today so we still wouldn’t have access to this. \n",
        "In Mongolia there are people researching bokh but none of them are doing research so it costs a lot of money to go and retrieve these. Now we are building the Genghis museum and we are starting to repatriate these artifacts. \n",
        "Thy were wearing lather trousers possibly because of riding horses. They would roll them up and tie them up for wrestling. The heroic ballads of the time when they established the empires depict that they roll them up by coupling the heroic ballads with the artifacts and artwork found they can piece the history together.\n",
        "Chinese era artwork showed wrestling which China claimed with shauijiao, they influenced each other. There is really no way to know from the pictures which one it is. One picture showed men wrestling with no shirt, only briefs inside a circle that was exactly like sumo and the Chinese call it shampoo which is the same as the word for sumo. Anthropologist said actually thy are not briefs. They are trousers which have been rolled up and the were gripping the trousers and wearing boots so it looked like Mongolian wrestling. In sumo the wrestlers are barefoot. \n",
        "The Sketh people migrated from Asia to Europe and this artwork showed Sketh people or the faces looked like that. The discovery was made in Ordos which is inner Mongolia and is a central point for discoveries from Asia from many cultures and this could be from many cultures. Maybe the wrestling was one kind which branched into many kinds. \n",
        "Kitan People the pictures looked more similar to Mongolian Bokh and they are waring short pants for the first time. And they are wearing a jacket which covers the whole upper body. The legend says that because of princess kuntalun they changed the jacket so no women could wrestle but he said it is just a myth. It is a fact that Mongolians used to war the full shirt but we do not know why they changed. \n",

In Japan we were doing very high training in high school and we had a lot of competitions in summer in Japan.

        "Mongolians lived a Mongolian lifestyle. They tended toward herding. The environment cultivated Mongolian Bökh, catching horses, pinning them are all related to wrestling, particularly herding. When the baby horses are drinking you have to hold them in place and control them and this builds up strength. They are not domestic they are wild animals. You have to train them domesticize them. That is also wrestling. All of the things you do in nomadic lifestyle come out in wrestling throw a lasso and pull on the lasso until the animal falls down. He said it was like practicing seonagi. And not just males but also females. When you milk the animals you tie them together in a long line and go trough milking children do this. Agriculture made Mongolian Bökh, you have to fight with the animals to take them down and pin them grappling, holding and twisting. You would have to grab the nose and with no tools pin them and keep them their until they had no resistance. That is all wrestling and the reason Mongolians have success in wrestling in the world is because of this would nomadic lifestyle  harsh lifestyle. You had to cut fire wood, break the ice to get drinking water, carry the water. \n",
        "If there were a lot of animals around you, you would have to control them and connect psychologically, which one do I have to hold which one do I have to control to make sure the others don’t run away. During a wrestling match this is similar you would have to think fast if I grab this way he moves that way if I move that way he moves that way. You have to talk to the animals with your eyes and your breath hypnotize them or they will run away. You have to keep them calm or they could attack you and tear you apart. So you have to be careful. The animals are very smart. The baby horse just opening its eyes know this is the mother this my father and this is my herder. \n",
        "Once you have been with a horse for many years on the battlefield they become your partner and they would support you when you were injured or tired, holding you up if you buy an animal it is not the same you do not have the connection with that animal. Bökh will be lifting animals every day until the animal reaches 100 kilograms or 200 kilograms. There are people who lift horses and cows and camels and they walk around the ger. Powerlifting is useless but lifting animals, they are alive, they move around and attack you while you are lifting them so it is more difficult and very effective more. During the last century Mongolians had no contact with foreigners in the 1960s people had no concept of freestyle wrestling. And in standing wrestling the Mongolians could make them fall, even Olympic champions but on the ground the Mongolians didn’t know what to do. But people were socked to see the Mongolians throw the Olympic champions. We did not know how to fight on the ground but we were able to get 6th place. In Japan \n",
        "No one had seen our Bökh, yet. They didn’t know. Since it is connected to herding it is inherited. If your brother and your dad are wrestlers then the children will also learn to wrestle.

They would take the animal’s stomach, blow it up and fill it wash and you would kickit and elbow it and duck and bob and weave Mongolian training method. Mongolian Bökh, shifted with the times.

One thing about the heritage of Mongolian Bökh. So, the people come from specific regions where they eat those foods plant breath that air eat that meat and so the people grow differently in the different regions. This goes generation to generation and effects their genetics. If they move to a different region this will stop. The best are in Western provinces, Bayarmunkh is from West. \n",

        "Recently retired, Mongolian born sumo wrestler, Gouchouzan Masashi(Ugaanbaatar Delgersaikhan) said that, for the most part, the Japanese did not differentiate between Mongolian and Japanese sumo wrestlers. “There can be instances where the teacher scolds the wrestler to sharpen their mentality or to demote their motivation, but it is uncommon to be singled out, because of race.” The one caveat he added was that the rules often exclude retired, foreign wrestlers from becoming trainers and stable masters. The reason for these rules, he believed, was to protect the Japanese culture and to preserve the purity of sumo, “so that there won’t be any foreign based policy that would direct the sumo into a different direction.”\n",

        "What was the hardest part of adjusting to Sumo life in Japan?\n",
        "At first when I came to Japan as a high school student it was hard for me to understand the language and the culture itself. However, after graduating from high school in Japan it was easier for me to cope with the professional sumo wrestling environment due to the fact that I had already gotten through the difficulties that I had during my high school years in Japan.\n",

        "In terms of Mongolian wrestling the briefs and the jacket are located much higher but for Sumo wrestling it is much lower and we call that a mawashi in sumo, and I think that it is generally two different things when it comes to differentiating mongolian wrestling and Sumo wrestling. However, there seems to be a lot of advantage for Mongolian wrestlers wrestling as a sumo wrestler in Japan. One of the clear examples is that people who used to wrestle in Mongolia tend to have that upper hand in the grip and as well as the alignment in their movement but it usually depends on the adaptivity of the individual, not only that if the individual possess the advantage in mongolian wrestling it is common to see them applying those certain techniques from mongolian wrestling during their sumo wrestling match, yet i have seen people using sumo wrestling techniques as their main foundation in their movements/techniques and applying certain Mongolian wrestling techniques on top of their general skills that they obtained from sumo wrestling training. Even so Mongolian wrestling techniques becomes more useful after learning the general exercises of sumo wrestling so that it will be easier and much more effective to apply the mongolian wrestling techniques on top of it. \n",
        "Do Japanese people accept the Mongolian sumo wrestlers? Why or Why not?\n",
        "They don’t differentiate us in any way and most of the time it usually depends on the teacher. There can be instances where the teacher scolds the wrestler to sharpen their mentality or to demote their motivation but it is uncommon to get racially profiled. However, there are some cases where the sumo association neglects retired mongolian wrestlers who are working as a teacher that will once join the sumo association. The reason behind that is mainly because the sumo associations think that they should be run by the pure bloods who are originally from Japanese culture meaning that the sumo association is strongly against enrolling foriegn people or foreign wrestlers and sumo teachers into the association, so that there won’t be any foriegn based policy that would direct the sumo into a different direction.\n",

        "The faster you adapt with the culture the more it will be for you to find opportunities here in sumo wrestling and the path has already been paved by the former Mongolian wrestlers so it will be much easier for the younger generation to find their way of learning and making accomplishments in the future. Not only that, self development should be one of your top priorities to find more about yourself and to find your way of wrestling in sumo in order to perfect yourself in the ways of wrestling. \n",

Mass Media tried to make a question: ‘are Mongolian sumo players acceptable for Japanese culture or not, I think not!’\". \n",

For the sumo committee, such an expressive champion is intolerable, because for them, the ideal Yokozun is calm, dignified, and does not show his feeling.”\n",
        "On the other hand, Imamura Hiroyuki felt that the Mongolians were good for sumo because they brought a new attitude, new techniques, and a foreign perspective. “Culture needs evolution and revolution. Foreign wrestling techniques and mentality make the traditionalist committee rethink what sumo is, in terms of techniques, philosophy and pedagogy. One of the foreign sumo player's role is trickster for the sumo committee, so I like to see them.”\n",

On the other hand, Japanese is usually not interested in social situation and politics, as long as such situation makes trouble for them. In other words, Japanese are easy to be controled for politicians. So we need so much materials to think what happened in real world.

Our Mongolian traditional wrestling has many unique aspects ever since the old days.

        "things.\n",
        "- Any difference from Mongolians?\n",

        "Mongolian wrestlers. These techniques had existed in sumo before that, but due to the excess weight,\n",
        "attempting such techniques were extremely risky and there’s the added rule of losing the match by ring\n",
        "out, it wasn’t as utilized. Those who weigh 200, 300 kilograms, they can only attack forward. Those who\n",
        "make use of techniques mostly are lighter wrestlers. Kyokushuzan and Harumafuji and such wrestled that\n",

        "there and become champions. There’s no prejudice, I feel. There are many audience/fan groups\n",
        "that support Mongolian or European sumo wrestlers. Americans and Europeans, they tend to\n",

        "Japan, but they allow foreigners to become sumo wrestlers and even Yokozuna.\n",
        "Why do you think they do that?\n",
        "It’s because it's a professional sport. Those foreign sports like MMA or NBA doesn’t have\n",

        "9. Which Japanese sumo wrestler do you think is close to becoming Yokozuna?\n",
        "Ah, it’s hard to say. There was a guy that I thought had the potential, who recently got tangled up\n",
        "in happenings and was suspended from wrestling for six years.\n",
        "- And who was this?\n",
        "Asanoyama. Yeah. I used to think he would be the one.\n",

        "Interview Ganbold Coach\n",
        "Why are Mongolians dominating sumo?\n",
        "This is due to Mongolian wrestling. There is a specialty. In sumo wrestling, if the competitor\n",

        "such as sheep or a goat. These animals are akin to a package of natural nutrients due to their\n",
        "lifestyle/environment as well. 8 years ago, WHO declared Mongolia is the only country that has\n",
        "sustained its nomadic culture in the modern age. This resulted in Mongolian men having good,\n",
        "natural inputs (referring to nutrients). Another point is the nature of wild livestocks. Even if\n",
        "they’re not carnivores, they are still wild animals and require strength and technique to\n",
        "domesticate. They will attack, dash, escape and headbutt you and you have to be ready to deal\n",
        "with any of it. Take milking a mare for an example, they may lash out and run away. Mongolians\n",

        "Mongolian Bokh is based on space like sumo wrestling. Sumo is a traditional, singular sport that\n",

        "Zorigt Zorky Ulaankhuu, the head trainer of  Zorky MMA, said he has fighters fighting outside of Mongolia, fighters in Bellator MMA, One FC, and also Russia, Asia, and the United States. One of his former fighters is now signed to UFC, but he now belongs to Jackson Wink MMA, a leading US MMA camp. \n",
        "Zorigt Zorky Ulaankhuu: “MMA in Mongolia started around 2010. At that time, there were only about four or five guys training, and they were fighting in promotions in Asia. In 2014, Narantungalag Jadambaa became the first Mongolian to win the ONE FC Featherweight Championship. This inspired a lot of young guys to start training MMA. Mongolians didn’t believe they could win, but when he won, they began to believe they could win in any organization in the world.”\n",
        "Zorigt Zorky Ulaankhuu feels the Mongolian advantages are, “First, the blood of the ancestors. Second, the way of life, the location, the extreme weather. And because the weather is changing, it makes the body stronger. They can tolerate any pain and can survive in any conditions. The food we eat is completely organic. We eat a lot of meat and milk. And it’s all free-range organic. The animals eat grass and herbs, and that makes the meat more nutritious. When athletes train, they lose a lot of minerals. Mongolian food helps them recover. In summer, they drink horse milk. That helps. And the lamb and beef they eat are like vitamins. Athletes in other countries take supplements, but with the food we eat we don’t have to take them.” \n",
        "Zorigt Zorky Ulaankhuu: “My fighters are mixed, countryside and city fighters. When countryside people come, they are strong, but the city kids grow up in the streets, and have more experience than countryside people. Countryside boys, in the beginning, they have a lot of power, but not much experience. But then they all start training and they catch up. Boys growing up in the city do sambo, judo, and wrestling. They also compete a lot. But in the countryside, they just wrestle with each other and the animals.”\n",
        "Zorigt Zorky Ulaankhuu: “The disadvantage is stamina. We live at a high altitude, then we go to Southeast Asia, and it’s too hot for them. We train in Shiren Beelii MMA club to prepare for Southeast Asia fights, because it’s in a basement, with no ventilation. If we’re fighting in Russia, we prepare somewhere else. And America is so big, we have to choose the places to train for the fights. Before fighting in Las Vegas, we can go train in the Gobi.” \n",
        "Zorigt Zorky Ulaankhuu: “The wrestling level in Mongolia is high, similar to Chechens and Dagestanis. Every father, when we grow up, if we meet and go outside, we put our kids together and let them wrestle. This is the tradition. The kids wrestle each other. In China, for example, they don’t do that, but in Mongolia, children are wrestling all the time. But today it’s training. Many of the city boys don’t wrestle much. Countryside boys are still wrestling. But teaching them is easy because it’s in the blood. And if the father was a wrestler, they grow up seeing wrestling their whole life. So they’re easy to teach. If the father is a businessman maybe they don’t grow up wrestling, but if the father is a wrestler, then they grow up with that.”\n",
        "Zorigt Zorky Ulaankhuu: “Many people think boxing is the most important skill in MMA, but you have to modify it. If you do amateur boxing techniques in MMA, you will lose. The same is true for jujitsu. If you do in the MMA tournament the same as the BJJ tournament you’ll get killed. So we take techniques from the best teachers and modify that for MMA. The black belt in jujitsu isn’t so important. They train with the gi and rules and going for advantage and scoring… boxing is the same. They go for the score. Yes, KO is important, but they’re fighting for points. MMA is not like that. With MMA you have to go for the win. MMA is fighting. If you only do boxing, someone is going to take you down and beat you. That’s why you have to mix it. That’s why as a coach, I understand. Whoever understands this part, their fighters will adjust and succeed.” \n",
        "Zorigt Zorky Ulaankhuu: “We’re behind the Americans, because MMA has been going on there for 30 years, but in Mongolia for only 10. Our stamina training is lagging behind, but it’s catching up. Maybe in five years we’ll catch up. And I also think we’ll be more boxers than wrestlers. I go to America a lot and I travel and see the best American teams and try to see what’s different about what they are doing. We are behind training in drills and stuff, but we are ahead in the striking.”\n",
        "Zorigt Zorky Ulaankhuu: “Mongolian fighters are tough and brave. Fighting is the sport of the brave. If you have no heart, you cannot fight. If you train 100%, and you’re a good fighter, but you have no heart, you can’t fight. Maybe you can be an average fighter. But, you cannot be a champion. The special techniques of Mongolian fighters are kicking the leg, sweeping the legs. We have thousands of moves from Mongolian wrestling. This is in judo, in wrestling, in sambo, because we have thousands of moves from our wrestling. Like Khabib, when Mongolians are on top, they are unstoppable. They’re too strong. Mongolians are similar, physically, to the Chechens and Dagestanis. They’re just really quick to react, adapt, and overcome and survive.”\n",
        "Interview With Lavell Marshall \n",
        "Lavell Marshall is an American who has been living and wrestling Bökh in Inner Mongolia, since 2018. He has moved to the countryside, from the provincial capital of Hohhot, and plans to stay at least a year. \n",
        "Marshall: “In Inner Mongolia, we don’t have just one Naadam. We have Naadams almost every day, from May to September. I did three in the last three days. They normally have more, but because of the pandemic they canceled a lot of them, I did three the week before, some the week before that… Yesterday was 256-man Naadam, and I got to the third round. I was doing really well. One of my matches was over 30 minutes long, but then he caught me. It’s no joke. I was training in Hohhot, but because of the coronavirus the team was not really allowed to train, so my coaches and teachers, my coach is my best friend here, invited me out to the grassland to train with them. And they’re training regularly. I’m trying to understand the culture and mindset, because there are no Chinese out here. You have to understand [them] to do Bökh. You can’t use Chinese shuai jiao wrestling mentality in Bökh. The techniques may work, but the mindset won’t work. Bökh is a slower pace. It requires patience. Shuai jiao is a fast-paced mentality.” \n",
        "Marshall: “In yesterday’s matches, I was very calm and relaxed, fighting one person at a time, rather than thinking about winning the whole thing. My second match was 30 minutes and my opponent was no scrub. Today, I rushed. My opponent was a scrub and I rushed, and he caught me. Sometimes I can’t get out of the go-go mentality of shuai jiao. And I was the one trying to execute the technique, and he caught me. And the ruleset is that if you fall at all ,you are done. So, you have to change your mentality, or you’ll pay.” \n",
        "Marshall: “There are Naadams all summer long, all year, really, but in summer nearly every day. And the average wrestler does about 50 per summer or more. My goal was to do 50 or 60. My main goal is to be the first foreigner to get a janga (a ranking). The only way you can get it is by winning in Naadam.” \n",
        "Marshall: “The sweeps that they do, the leg kicks, which to them are sweeps, those are some of the similarities between Inner and Outer Mongolia. Inside-trip, the gripping is different and the rules are different. Inner Mongolia it’s more about counters and pressure downwards with the grips, whereas in Outer Mongolia, there’s more grabbing a single leg and running through people. Both have a lot of pressure, but the pressure is different. In Inner Mongolia, it’s all about circles. The geer is circle. The ovoo stones shrines are in a circle. You walk around the ring in circles, trying to get angles, and catching your opponent with sneaky trips. I see both styles all the time and I’m well-aware of the differences and the mindset, and how to train for them.” \n",
        "Marshall: “I live in Zhunzun. It’s a couple of buildings in the middle of nowhere. It was very difficult to find a place, but I found one. Now I’m planning through next summer to be here. Who knows what the future is? I didn’t know last year I’d be here. Hoa is the head coach of this place, and I’ll go to his place in winter and train indoors, but all summer we train outside. He’s actually the coach for shuai jiao and Bökh. That is a plus for me, because I do both, and he knows how to put them together, and mix them together, and make them that much better. He was a shuai jiao champion many times. He’s a badass.” \n",
        "Marshall: “China hasn’t been so friendly to Instagram and recently it’s been worse, nearly impossible to post anything on Instagram and social media. Plus, most of the stuff I want to say — or at least half of it — China probably wouldn’t like. Next summer, I want to go to Outer Mongolia and train their art, after learning and ramping up here. Inner Mongolia is huge and most people think it looks the same, but if you know the culture, then you see that it’s different. You see that the northeast is different. Most of Inner Mongolia has the janga, a ribbon necklace, but the area around Hulunbuir has shin guards with animals on them. That’s their ranking system.” \n",
        "Marshall: “There are three ways to get the janga: first, win a 256-man competition, or three 128-man comps, or someone from your place, like a retiring wrestler, can hand his down to a promising prospect, and kind of pass his janga down. Getting one also depends on what competition they have — town, region, league, or national. And you can get a master, which is the highest rank you can get. They did not have elephant and lion, like in Outer Mongolia, but they are starting to. They also didn’t have the hat before, but it is becoming more common now. But the janga is the most important thing. Once you have a janga you’re automatically a beast, but depending on what you win, you can have different titles. We have a friend called ‘Rhino Killer.’ He’s small, but destroys everyone. He earned master and is ranked no. 1 in Inner Mongolia, but I’ve seen him lose to a low-ranked guy. I saw a master loose to a 140 lbs (64 kg) guy. The next day, he went to a Naadam and destroyed everyone.” \n",
        "Marshall: “From Hulunbuir, they wear different pants and a different outfit and do a different dance when they run out. You can’t grab the legs in Mongolian wrestling in Inner Mongolia, but many of the guys also do shuai jiao and judo and now the techniques are changing. In Outer Mongolia, it’s becoming less technical, and is more about strength. And more guys are taking steroids. It is less about tricky techniques. In Inner Mongolia, they’re trickier. You can get a big fat dude, and he’ll outmaneuver you, jump in the air, twist, and everything. Everything they do is more calculated because you can’t grab the legs. If you weigh 150 lbs (68 kg) and need to throw a guy who’s 350 lbs (159 kg), you need to be smart. Once Mongolians realize they could do well in MMA, translating their Mongolian wrestling to MMA, they’ll open some eyes. Right now, they’re still living the old way, but they need to find a balance.” \n",
        "Marshall: “There are some hard people, but they love to be lazy when they can be, but they eventually get to work. They don’t believe in time or anything like that. I keep trying to teach them that in the Western world, you can’t live like a nomadic person. There has to be a plan, particularly if you want to spread the art. There has to be a plan. You can’t just do it whenever you want. The training school was closed for months. I couldn’t train and the reason I came to China was to train. Now I’m out on the grassland training, and just getting back into the groove.” \n",
        "Marshall: “The Outer Mongolians all do steroids. You see them when they come here. They’re bigger than the Inner Mongolians, huge. And the Inner and Outer Mongolians all eat the same stuff. So the Outer Mongolians must be doing drugs. You see old guys in their thirties and find they’re the same age as me. I can’t believe it. They age so fast. Every day in the competitions, you’ll see some fat guys destroying people, not even lasting ten minutes. I have seen guys who look like they couldn’t get out of bed… one of the biggest, sloppiest guys I’ve ever seen, and he made it to the top four or maybe it was the top two. He was so huge they couldn’t move him. Even the really good guys couldn’t move him, but sometimes that’s just how it goes. It’s just part of the game. It sucks to be small sometimes. I’ve seen a guy here, older, wearing jeans with a cigarette in his mouth, walk in and beat half the guys in the competition. In America, you don’t see that. But it’s part of the culture here.”\n",
        "Marshall: “They tell me all the time there are only two times, morning and afternoon. I’m like, ‘Yeah, but you don’t know when those are.’ Sometimes it annoys me. I got used to it. It always works out, because when everyone is about that, no one cares. It’s easy to not be stressed about it, but we have that Western mentality, you call and say, ‘Where are you? You said you’d pick me up this afternoon, and its five o’clock already.’ It’s interesting, until I order some stuff and want it delivered. When people are supposed to come deliver something or pick something up, they say they’ll be there in ten minutes, but come hours later, and just expect you to wait for hours. I have stories for days. It’s become quite an adventure. I tell them that in the US, I’m considered terrible with time and planning, but you guys make me look like a German. They make me feel like a really strict, on-point human being, when actually I’m really lazy by Western standards, as far as being on-time is concerned.” \n",
        "Marshall: “I’ve been doing a lot of podcasts. People are raising superficial questions, not getting to the heart of it. They ask ‘Do they ride horses’, and I say ‘You can get that from any documentary.’ I need to tell the real details because I have a lot to say. I’m not a big guy, but I’m strong for my size when it comes to wrestling. The guys here have short, thick legs and you can’t move them, but I can always control their arms. It is different. Guys have different conditioning. Their wrists and arms are strong, but not in that way. They don’t train it in that way. There’s a guy, he’s a beast, and I was training with him last week. We first trained no jacket. I caught him 12 times. And, I thought, this is weird, he’s known for wrestling horses. He controlled me with a jacket, though. And my shuai jiao grips are good, but I’m still learning grips in Mongolian. I’m pretty explosive and can move in and out, but with the jacket, he could control me, negating that movement. But we put the jackets on, and he just manhandled me. It’s just so different how the strength can be used if there’s no jacket or which grips are being used, and I could control his arms… so it was really weird. \n",
        "Marshall: “I’m half German, born in Germany, lived there till 13. Mom is German. Germans are always on time. I’m not, but Mongolians think I am. I’m 30 minutes late, and they think I’m early. When I move back to the US, I could never have a regular job again. It’ll never work out anymore. I’m helping my coach move tomorrow, but I don’t know at what time. He doesn’t know. There hasn’t been anyone doing what I’m doing at all, ever. There have been a few guys that have come through. I know who Tim Foley is, Wrestling Roots in Inner Mongolia... A few guys came through for a few days and they didn’t learn anything and no one knew them.” \n",
        "Naimen, an Inner Mongolian training in Mongolia, told this researcher that he knew Hangai (Marshall’s Mongolian name). He said he had trained in the same place as Hangai but was sure that Hangai did not know him. \n",
        "Marshall: “They love me here because I’m staying here. I’ve had friends stay and train  and they learned a few little tricks, but they don’t understand. I’ve been here a while now, and I still don’t understand and my grips still suck, but I want to be able to go to any Naadam and get into the top 16 or top 8 at any time. I don’t really settle for average. No foreigner has ever got a janga. If you don’t have one, you’re not proficient. You’re not anything. You’re just a person who wrestles a little bit. I love a little bit of attention, but that’s just me, personally.” \n",
        "Marshall: “An American guy wrestled in Beijing on Sunday. Compared to the guys in Inner Mongolia, the Americans who’ve wrestled here are nothing. Advice for Americans wrestling Bökh: If you get beat in eight seconds your first time out, that’s OK for the first one. I’ve got beat in two seconds so it happens. But let’s try and make it eight minutes next time.” \n",
        "Marshall: “The hard part about Inner Mongolia is that it’s hard to get the wrestling. I got hooked up, but for Mongolian wrestling, it’s hard. You have to go to the middle of nowhere. They’re very standoffish if they don’t like or know you or if you’re Chinese. They won’t say anything to you. Once they know you and like you, they will give you everything. I train private lessons, classes, everything, and they take me to Naadams for free, and never ask me for anything. They said they want me to be the guy who spreads Bökh to the world.” \n",
        "Marshall: “I’ve heard of Tim Cartmell, who translated The Method of Chinese Wrestling, and I have the book. I know he did a lot. My thing is, I question the skills of a lot of the guys who write books. Do they know what they’re talking about? I don’t mean Tim. Do they really know a lot or can they talk and say stuff because no one knows better? When I write a book, I’ll be a champion first ,so people will see I know what I’m talking about, that I’m not just talking.” \n",
        "Marshall, who mentioned that he hardly ever meets Han Chinese, said that two documentaries and a movie featuring him are in the pipeline, but the details are still being worked out. \n",
        "Marshall: “In the real Naadams, they don’t let in foreigners unless they’re Outer Mongolian or Tuva, but now I can go to any Naadam and they let me take part. They consider me Mongolian. They don’t let just anyone move to the grasslands. We had to meet with all of these people and leaders, but they let us do it. And no foreigner has ever done it in 700 years, since Marco Polo. The teacher of the team we train with for Chinese wrestling is a beast,  hundreds of competitions, 12-time champion for shuai jiao… he’s the no. 1 coach for Chinese wrestling here. All of his students are champions. Some days, we do both. We bring both jackets to training. All of the wrestlers, even the ones who do shuai jiao, are Mongolians. This is their culture and their heritage.”\n",

KRISHNA WAS SAVED FROM KAMSA\\'S WRATH AND RAISED BYA COWHERD COUPLE, NANDA AND YASODA. BUT WHEN KAMSA HEARD THAT KRISHNA, THE EIGHT CHILDREN, WAS ALIVE HEDECIDED TO KILL HIM. HE CALLED KRISHNA AND BALARAMA TO THE \"HARBOUR FESTIVAL\" WHERE A WRESTLING MATCH WAS TO BEHELD. THE TWO BROTHERS DEFEATED KAMSA\\'S WRESTLERS IN A MATCH. KAMSA WAS PREPARED FOR KRISHNA\\'S ATTACK, FOR HEKNEW FROM THE BEGINNING THAT HE WAS TO BE THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH. HE IMMEDIATELY UNSHEATHED HIS SWORD ANDPREPARED TO ANSWER THE CHALLENGE OF KRISHNA WITH SWORD AND SHIELD. AS KAMSA WIELDED HIS SWORD UP AND DOWN,HITHER AND THITHER, KRISHNA CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM WITH GREAT FORCE KNOCKING THE CROWN FROM HIS HEAD. HE THENDRAGGED KAMSA FROM HIS SEAT TO THE WRESTLING DAIS AND THREW HIM DOWN. THEN KRISHNA AT ONCE STRADDLED HIS CHESTAND BEGAN TO STRIKE HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SIMPLY FROM THE STROKES OF KRISHNA\\'S FIST, KAMSA WAS KILLED(PRABHUPADA, 1970).ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SPORT AND LITERATURE CAN BE FOUND IN THE TWO MAJOR SANSKRIT EPICS OFANCIENT INDIA, THE MAHABHARATA AND THE RAMAYANA (DATTA, 1988). THE OLDEST PRESERVED PARTS OF THE MAHABHARATAARE NOT THOUGHT TO BE APPRECIABLY OLDER THAN AROUND 400 B.C., THOUGH THE ORIGINS OF THE STORY PROBABLY DATEBETWEEN THE 8TH AND 9TH CENTURIES B.C. IT IS IN THIS EPIC THAT WE FIND THE LONGEST DESCRIBED WRESTLING MATCH. ITHAPPENED BETWEEN BHEEMA, ONE OF FIVE PHANDVA BROTHERS, AND JARASANDHA, A GREAT AND LEGENDARY KING OFMAGADHA.YUDHISTHIRA, KING OF INDRAPRASTHA AND LATER OF HASTINAPURA (KURU) AND THE LEADER OF THE PANDAVA SIDE IN THEKURUKSHETRA WAR, WAS PLANNING TO MAKE A RAJASUYA YAGNA, A SACRIFICE PERFORMED BY THE ANCIENT KINGS OF INDIAWHO CONSIDERED THEMSELVES POWERFUL ENOUGH TO BE AN EMPEROR (DOWSON, 1870), IN ORDER TO BECOME AN EMPERORHIMSELF. KRISHNA CONVINCED HIM THAT JARASANDHA WAS THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO OPPOSE YUDHISTHIRA FROM BECOMING ANEMPEROR. KRISHNA PLANNED A CLEVER SCHEME TO MAKE BHEEMA WRESTLE WITH THE PROUD BUT AGEING JARASANDHA. THEWRESTLING MATCH LASTED 27 DAYS. THEY WRESTLED IN THE MALLA-YUDDHA WAY, I.E. IN A WAY THAT WAS TO BECOME THETRADITIONAL SOUTH ASIAN FORM OF COMBAT-WRESTLING (ALTER, 1992). KRISHNA KNEW THE SECRET BY WHICH JARASANDHACOULD BE KILLED. SINCE JARASANDHA WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE WHEN THE TWO LIFELESS HALVES JOINED TOGETHER, CONVERSELY, HECAN BE KILLED ONLY WHEN HIS BODY WAS TORN INTO TWO HALVES. KRISHNA TOOK A STICK, BROKE IT INTO TWO AND THREW THEMIN BOTH DIRECTIONS. BHEEMA GOT THE HINT. HE TORE JARASANDHA\\'S BODY INTO TWO AND THREW THE PIECES IN TWO DIRECTIONS.BUT, THESE TWO PIECES CAME TOGETHER AND JARASANDHA WAS ABLE TO ATTACK BHEEMA AGAIN. BHEEMA GOT TIRED AFTERSEVERAL SUCH FUTILE ATTEMPTS. HE AGAIN SOUGHT THE HELP OF KRISHNA. THIS TIME, KRISHNA TOOK A STICK, BROKE IT INTOTWO AND THREW THE LEFT PIECE ON RIGHT SIDE AND THE RIGHT PIECE ON THE LEFT SIDE. BHEEMA PRECISELY FOLLOWED THE SAME.NOW, HE TORE JARASANDHA\\'S BODY INTO TWO AND THREW THEM IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. THUS, JARASANDHA WAS KILLED AS THETWO PIECES COULD NOT MERGE INTO ONE.OTHER EARLY LITERARY DESCRIPTIONS OF WRESTLING MATCHES, IN THE ANCIENT EPICS OF INDIA, INCLUDE THE STORY OF BALARAMA,AND THE RAMAYANA\\'S ACCOUNT OF THE VANARA KING VALI DEFEATING RAVANA, THE KING OF LANKA, IN A WRESTLING CONTEST.ALSO, THERE ARE STORIES DESCRIBING KRISHNA REPORT THAT HE WAS SOMETIMES ENGAGED IN WRESTLING MATCHES WHERE HEUSED KNEE STRIKES TO THE CHEST, PUNCHES TO THE HEAD, HAIR PULLING, AND STRANGLEHOLDS (GREEN & SVINTH, 2010).PERSIAN POET HAKIM ABOL-GHASEM FERDOWSI TOOSI (C.977 AND 1010 A.D.) LEFT US THE WORK OF CENTRAL IMPORTANCEIN PERSIAN CULTURE, ALSO REGARDED AS A LITERARY MASTERPIECE AND THE CLASSICS OF THE WORLD, THE SHAHNAMEH OR SHAH-NAMA, IN TRANSLATION \"THE BOOK OF KINGS\". THE SHAHNAMEH IS A LONG EPIC POEM CONSISTING OF SOME 60,000 VERSES(DAVIS, 2006). IN IT THE POET IMMORTALIZES THE ANCIENT LEGENDARY KINGS AND HEROES OF IRAN FROM THE CREATION OF THEWORLD UNTIL THE ISLAMIC CONQUEST OF PERSIA IN THE 7TH CENTURY. IN THE EPIC TALE, SUHRAB AND HIS FATHER RUSTAM, THEPREEMINENT PROTAGONIST OF THE SHAHNAMA, HAVE NEVER MET. SUHRAB WAS IN PERPETUAL SEARCH OF HIS FATHER, WHOM HEKNEW TO BE RUSTAM, BUT WHOSE FACE HE DID NOT KNOW. WHEN THEY FINALLY DO MEET, IT WAS ON THE WAR BATTLEFIELDBETWEEN IRAN AND TURAN, NEITHER KNEW THAT THEY WERE FATHER AND SON. AS NO ONE ELSE DARED TO FIGHT ROSTAM,SOHRAB, KNOWN AS THE BEST YOUNG FIGHTER OF TURAN ARMY, WAS SENT TO WRESTLE WITH THE LEGENDARY PERSIAN HERO. HISPLAN WAS TO ATTACK IRAN, INSTALL RUSTAM ON THE IRANIAN THRONE AND THEN THEY WOULD ATTACK TURAN AND TOGETHER RULETHE WORLD. THEY STARTED TO WRESTLE. AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF BATTLE, SUHRAB\\'S TASTE OF VICTORY AND BOAST WAS CONTRASTEDWITH RUSTAM\\'S DREAD OF POSSIBLE DEFEAT. FOR HIM TO WITHDRAW FROM BATTLE WAS UNTHINKABLE; ON THE OTHER, TOCONTINUE IN BATTLE MEANT POSSIBLE DEFEAT AND THEREFORE LOST OF HIS REPUTATION BEFORE TWO WATCHING ARMIES, WHICHWAS ALSO UNTHINKABLE. ON THE BATTLE FIELD, WITHOUT STATING THE REASON, SOHRAB TOLD HIS RIVAL THAT HE WOULD NOT FIGHTAGAINST ROSTAM. THUS ROSTAM DID NOT REVEAL HIS NAME. AFTER A VERY LONG AND HEAVY WRESTLE, ROSTAM FELT WEAK ANDAFRAID TO SPOIL HIS REPUTATION, SO HE STABBED HIS SON IN THE HEART. TAHMINA, WHO CAME TO THE FIELD TO KEEP THEM FROMBLOODSHED, WAS TOO LATE AND SOHRAB DIED ON HIS MOURNING FATHER\\'S HANDS (ARNOLD & TRENT, 2005).52\\x0c© CENTRE FOR PROMOTING IDEAS, USA WWW.IJHSSNET.COM1.1 WHEN THE TWO WORLDS COLLIDEWRESTLING IS ONE OF THE OLDEST SPORTS THAT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE BEGINNINGS OF RECORDED HISTORY. IN THIS ARTICLE,THE AUTHORS WILL BRING AN OVERVIEW OF ANCIENT WRESTLING COMBATS RECORDED IN MANY DIFFERENT LITERARY WORKS ANDLEGENDS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. SOME OF THE LITERARY WORKS AND LEGENDS ARE OVER THOUSAND YEARS OLD. AS IT ISIMPOSSIBLE, FOR THIS STAGE OF THE STUDY, TO LIST ALL THE LITERARY WORKS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD IN WHICH WE CAN READABOUT THE WRESTLING COMBAT, WE WILL PRESENT THE CHOSEN LITERARY TEXTS IN A CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER AS THEY APPEAR INTODAY\\'S LITERATURE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES. IN THIS WAY WE WILL TRY TO CONFIRM HYPOTHESIS THAT WRESTLING, THROUGH ART,CONNECTS DIFFERENT PLACES AND PERIODS OF TIME, AS WELL AS CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES.WEAPONLESS COMBAT SPORTS HAVE EXISTED SINCE PREHISTORIC TIMES. SOME OF THE EARLIEST ACCOUNTS OF WRESTLING CAN BEFOUND IN WRESTLING MYTHOLOGY (F. P. MILLER, VANDOME, & JOHN, 2010B), THEREFORE WE ARE NOT SURPRISED THAT THEDESCRIPTIONS OF THE WRESTLING COMPETITIONS CAN BE FOUND IN THE EARLY STAGES OF LITERACY. AS IT HAS BEEN, FORTHOUSANDS OF YEARS, THE MOST POPULAR COMBAT SPORT, THE STRENGTH AND HEROISM OF THE ANCIENT HEROES AND THEIRMEMORABLE FIGHTS AND COMPETITIONS HAVE BEEN SUNG IN MANY DIFFERENT EARLIEST CULTURES (MESOPOTAMIA, EGYPTIAN,GREEK, ETC.) AND THEIR LITERARY TEXTS SUCH AS EPICS, EPOPEES, ESSAYS, NOVELS, ETC. MANY OF THOSE TEXTS STILL LIVE TODAYWRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TIME, NEVER BEING TRANSCRIBED INTO TODAY’S WRITING. TODAY WE KNOW FOR SURE THATWRESTLING IS ONE OF THE OLDEST FORMS OF COMBAT WITH REFERENCES TO IT AS EARLY AS THE ILIAD, IN WHICH HOMER RECOUNTSTHE TROJAN WAR IN THE 13TH OR 12TH CENTURY B.C. THE ORIGINS OF WRESTLING CAN BE TRACED BACK 15,000 YEARS THROUGHCAVE DRAWINGS IN FRANCE. BABYLONIAN AND EGYPTIAN RELIEFS DEPICT WRESTLERS USING MOST OF THE HOLDS KNOWN TO THEPRESENT-DAY SPORT. WRESTLING WAS A BIG PART OF ANCIENT GREEK LITERATURE, TOO. WRESTLING COMPETITIONS, BRUTAL INMANY ASPECTS, WERE THE NUMBER ONE SPORT OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES. THE ANCIENT ROMANS ADOPTED THE SPORT FROM THEGREEKS WRESTLING ELIMINATING MUCH OF ITS BRUTALITY. DURING THE MIDDLE AGES (FIFTH CENTURY TO FIFTEENTH CENTURY)WRESTLING STILL REMAINED POPULAR. IT EVEN ENJOYED THE PATRONAGE OF MANY ROYAL FAMILIES, INCLUDING THOSE OFENGLAND, FRANCE, AND JAPAN.2. AN OVERVIEW OF THE EARLY EPICS WITH REFERENCES TO WRESTLING COMBATSTHE FIRST EPIC IN WHICH WE CAN READ ABOUT THE WRESTLING COMBAT IS THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH, THE EARLIEST KNOWNWORKS OF LITERATURE TODAY. SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT IT ORIGINATES AS A SERIES OF SUMERIAN LEGENDS AND POEMS ABOUT APROTAGONIST OF THE STORY, GILGAMESH, THE KING OF URIC, WHICH WERE, LATER ON, FASHIONED INTO A LONGER AKKADIAN EPIC.THE EPIC BECAME WELL KNOWN THANKS TO ITS MANY THEMES, PLOT ELEMENTS, AND CHARACTERS THAT CAN BE FOUND IN THEHEBREW BIBLE IN TWO PLACES - IN THE STORIES OF ADAM AND EVE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN (BOTH STORIES INVOLVE ASERPENT), AS WELL AS IN THE STORY OF NOAH (A. R. GEORGE, 2003). ALTHOUGH TODAY WE CAN READ A REVISED VERSIONBASED ON NEWLY DISCOVERED AND PUBLISHED INFORMATION, THE EPIC IS STILL NOT COMPLETE (A. GEORGE, 2003).THIS LITERARY WORK OF ART TELLS A STORY ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GILGAMESH AND HIS CLOSE MALE COMPANION,ENKIDU. ACCORDING TO THE STORY, GILGAMESH WAS ONE-THIRD MAN AND TWO-THIRDS GOD. ON THE ONE HAND HE WAS VERYWISE, STRONG AND HANDSOME BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE WAS A VERY CRUEL RULER WHO OPPRESSED THE CITIZENS, TORTUREDHIS ALIENS, AND RAPED WOMEN. AT ONE POINT GODS DECIDED TO MAKE HIM AN EQUAL OPPONENT. THEY CREATED A PRIMITIVEMAN, ENKIDU, COVERED WITH HAIR, WHO LIVED IN THE WILD WITH ANIMALS. WHEN THE SHEPARD TRAPPER FIRST FOUND HIM HEBROUGHT HIM A TEMPLATE PROSTITUTE, SHAMHAT, IN ORDER TO DO THE FIRST STEP IN HIS CIVILIZATION SO HE COULD BE TAKEN TOTOWN. GILGAMESH AND ENKIDU MET IN URUK AT A WEDDING WHERE GILGAMESH ATTEMPTED TO VISIT THE WEDDING CHAMBER.ENKIDU BLOCKED HIS WAY AND THEY IMMEDIATELY STARTED WRESTLING. THE WRESTLING FIGHT LASTED ALL NIGHT, AND WHEN THEMORNING CAME THEY BECAME FRIENDS. LATER ON GILGAMESH AND ENKIDU FOUGHT IN MANY DANGEROUS QUESTS THATINCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF THE GODS. IN THEIR FINAL FIGHT TOGETHER THEY KILLED THE BULL OF HEAVEN SENT BY THE GODDESSISHTAR. THE RESULT WAS DISASTROUS. GODS DECIDED TO KILL ONE OF THE HEROES, ENKIDU. GILGAMESH DISTRESSED ANDSWALLOWED WITH SADNESS TOOK A LONG AND PERILOUS JOURNEY TO MEET THE IMMORTAL FLOOD HERO, UTNAPISHTIM.EVENTUALLY, GIGAMESH GOT KILLED IN THAT JOURNEY.FURTHERMORE, ILIAD AND ODYSSEY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EPICS OF THE 8\" CENTURY B.C. THE MAIN PROBLEM ISTHAT WE STILL DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ITS AUTHOR, HOMER. HE MAY HAVE LIVED AROUND 800 B.C. OR SOMEWHATEARLIER OR LATER. ONE COMMON LEGEND ABOUT HIM WAS THAT HE WAS BLIND. THAT STORY LEANS ON THE HYPOTHESIS THATDEMODOKOS, A BLIND POET IN ODYSSEY, IS THE INCARNATION OF HOMER HIMSELF. BEYOND THIS, THERE IS NO SOLIDINFORMATION. IN HIS EPICS HOMER SPEAKS ABOUT SEMI-MYTHICAL EVENTS THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN 1200 B.C. AND 800B.C.50\\x0cINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCE VOL. 3 NO. 5; MARCH 2013SPORT AND LITERATURE: AN OVERVIEW OF THE WRESTLING COMBATS IN THE EARLY LITERARYTEXTSANA PENJAKUNIVERSITY OF SPLITFACULTY OF KINESIOLOGYDEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGESCROATIAHRVOJE KARNINCICUNIVERSITY OF SPLITFACULTY OF KINESIOLOGYDEPARTMENT OF COMBAT SPORTSCROATIAABSTRACTSPORT HAS ALWAYS INSPIRED DIFFERENT ARTISTS, STARTING FROM THE ART OF PAINTING AND THE ART OF SCULPTURE TO LITERATURE.FORM ITS EARLY BEGINNINGS, DIFFERENT WRESTLING COMBATS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN LITERARY TEXTS.

FOR THEIR ANALYSIS, THE AUTHORS HAVE CHOSEN TEN TEXTSFROM THE MESOPOTAMIAN TO MIDDLE AGES LITERATURE. YET FOR ALL THESE CHALLENGES, THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THIS STUDYOF LITERARY REPRESENTATION OF WRESTLING WAS WORTHWHILE BECAUSE IT PROVIDED US INSIGHT INTO THE WAYS WHICHLITERATURE AND SPORT WERE ALWAYS CONNECTED.KEY WORDS: LITERATURE; SPORT; WRESTLING1. INTRODUCTION: CULTURE AND PLAY — THE ENTIRE LIFESTYLE OF A SOCIETYUMBERO ECO ONCE WROTE ’’SPORT IS MAN, SPORT IS SOCIETY” WISHING TO EMPHASIZE THAT SPORT REPRESENTS A CENTRALCULTURAL PLACE IN THE MANKIND CIVILIZATION (ECO, 1994). ETHIMOLOGICALLY, THE WORD SPORT COMES FROM THE LATIN WORDDEPORTO (DEPORTARE), I.E. TO CARRY AROUND, TO DELIVER, AND TO CONVEY. REFERRING TO ECO’S WORDS, SPORT AND PHYSICALACTIVITIES CAN BE TRACED TO THE BEGINNINGS OF RECORDED HISTORY I.E. FROM THE DAYS WHEN PEOPLE ORGANIZED FESTS ANDVARIOUS GAMES. IN THOSE DAYS SPORT WAS NOT AN INSTITUTIONALIZED TYPE OF A GAME, BUT IT WAS A PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE.OR AS KOKOVIC EXPLAINS: ’’SPORT WAS WORKERS’ GAME, LUDIC AND MAGICAL LIFESTYLE OF WORKING CLASS PEOPLE,“QUALIFIED CURS’ WHOSE AIM WAS TO PREPARE PEOPLE FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS HUNTING, WAR, ETC.’’ (KOKOVIC,1969). TWO THINGS LED TO A CONCLUSION ABOUT THE CONNECTION OF SPORT AND CULTURE (OSMOND & PHILLIPS, 2011). ONTHE ONE HAND, FAST GROWTH OF ALL KINDS OF SPORT LED TO A CONCLUSION THAT SPORT WAS SLOWLY BECOMING MASSPHENOMENON, WHETHER IT WAS JUST CONCERNING SPECTATORS OR ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, FASTERDEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE AND FIELDS DEALING WITH SPORT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE CORE AND THE FUNCTION OF SPORTIN SOCIO-CULTURAL CHANGES THAT HAVE LED TO HIGHER INTEREST IN SPORT.WHEN WE SAY CULTURE WE IMMEDIATELY THINK ABOUT LITERATURE, ART, PAINTING, MUSIC, ETC. PROFESSOR HUIZING, FROM THELAJDEN UNIVERSITY, EXPLAINED CULTURE IN A VERY PICTURESQUE WAY. HE SAID THE FOLLOWING: ’’IN THE PROCESS OFDEVELOPMENT, EVERY BIG FORM OF COLLECTIVE LIFE THERE IS, PRIMARILY ACTIVE AND FERTILE [...] WAS BORN IN A PLAY, ANDCONTINUES TO LIVE IN A FORM OF A PLAY. WISDOM AND SCIENCE WERE BORN FROM SACRED COMPETITION GAMES. LAW WASBORN FROM SOCIETY PLAY. ARMED FIGHT RULES, AND ARISTOCRACY CONVENTION LIFESTYLE WERE ALSO BASED ON VARIOUS FORMSOF PLAY. IN A WORD, IN ITS BEGINNING PHASES CULTURE WAS PLAYED. CULTURE IS BORN FROM A PLAY AS A LIVING FRUIT BEINGCUT OF THE MOTHER PLANT, IT DEVELOPS IN A PLAY AND AS A PLAY’’(HUIZINGA, 2003). THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO THEPROFESSOR’S WORDS CULTURE EMERGES FROM THE PLAY, I.E. PLAY IS THE FACTOR AND THE PICTURE OF EVERY CULTURE. OR ASHARALAMBOS AND HOLBORN CLAIM THAT CULTURE IS THE ENTIRE LIFESTYLE OF A CERTAIN SOCIETY (HARALAMBOS & HOLBORN,2008).49\\x0cINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCE VOL. 3 NO. 5; MARCH 2013VISION OF SAINT PERPETUA — MARTYR FROM CARTHAGE, OFFERS A VERY SIGNIFICANT WRESTLING MATCH BETWEEN GOOD ANDEVIL. VIBIJA PERPETUA IS A 22-YEAR-OLD CRISTIAN FROM NOBLE CARTAGE FAMILY (ROMAN PROVINCE OF AFRICA). IN THEMORNING OF THE 7TH MARCH 203, BECAUSE OF HER RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS, SHE WAS EXECUTED IN ARENA WITH OTHER MARTYRS(BARKER, 2010). SATURUS COMPANION OF PERPETUA RECORDED THEIR OWN VISIONS. HER LAST VISION WAS:ON THE EVE OF THE MARTYRDOM PERPETUA HAS YET ANOTHER VISION: SHE SEES HERSELF, AS A MALE ATHLETEANOINTED WITH OIL, WRESTLING AND OVERCOMING AN IMMENSE EGYPTIAN IN THE ARENA, - A SYMBOL OF THEDEVIL (SHAW, 1993).ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SPORT BEING A PART OF A LITERARY WORK CAN BE FOUND IN THE OLD ENGLISH HEROIC EPIC POEM,BEOWULF. BEOWULF CONSISTS OF 3182 ALLITERATIVE LONG LINES, AND IS OFTEN CITED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WORKS OFANGLO-SAXON LITERATURE. THE NAME OF THE POET WHO ASSEMBLED FROM TRADITION THE MATERIALS OF THIS STORY AND PUTTHEM IN THEIR FINAL FORM IS STILL UNKNOWN TO US. NOBODY KNOWS FOR CERTAIN WHEN THE POEM WAS FIRST COMPOSED. IT ISBELIEVED THAT THE WORK WAS COMPOSED BETWEEN THE 8TH (HIEATT & HIEATT, 1988; TOLKIEN, 1974) AND THE EARLY 11THCENTURY (KIERNAN, 1997). IN MORE THAN 3,000 LINES LONG, BEOWULF, A CLASSIC TALE OF THE TRIUMPH OF GOOD OVER EVIL,RELATES THE EXPLOITS OF ITS EPONYMOUS HERO NEATLY INTO THREE ACTS I.E. THREE SUCCESSIVE BATTLES - WITH A MONSTER,NAMED GRENDEL, WITH GRENDEL’S REVENGEFUL MOTHER, AND WITH A DRAGON WHICH WAS GUARDING A HOARD OF TREASURE.THE POEM OPENS IN DENMARK. GRENDEL, A TROLL-LIKE MONSTER, WAS TERRORIZING THE KINGDOM. THE GEATISH PRINCEBEOWULF HEARD OF HIS NEIGHBORS’ PLIGHT, AND SAILED TO THEIR AID WITH A BAND OF WARRIORS (SEC I-IT). BEOWULF AND HISMEN SPENT THE NIGHT IN HEOROT. BEOWULF BORE NO WEAPON AS GRENDEL WAS IMMUNE TO HUMAN WEAPONS. AFTER THEYFELL ASLEEP, GRENDEL ENTERED THE HALL AND ATTACKED, DEVOURING ONE OF BEOWULF\\'S MEN. THEN HE CLENCHED GRENDEL\\'SHAND. THE TWO WRESTLED UNTIL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE HALL MIGHT COLLAPSE. FINALLY, IN A WILD WRESTLING MATCHBEOWULF TORE GRENDEL\\'S ARM FROM HIS BODY (III-XID) AT THE SHOULDER AND GRENDEL RAN TO HIS HOME IN THE MARSHES TODIE. VICTORIOUS, BEOWULF WENT HOME TO GEATLAND IN SWEDEN AND LATER BECAME KING OF THE GEATS.VERY SHORT, BUT NEVERTHELESS LESS IMPORTANT STORY COMES FROM JAPAN. KOJIKI, THE OLDEST EXTANT CHRONICLE IN JAPANWHICH DATES FROM THE EARLY 8TH CENTURY (CHAMBERLAIN, 2008), IS A COLLECTION OF MYTHS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THEFOUR HOME ISLANDS OF JAPAN, AND THE KAMI. ACCORDING TO THE STORY JAPANESE EMPEROR TEMMU, DURING THE 7THCENTURY, SET ABOUT TO CORRECT INCONSISTENCIES WITHIN THE NATIONAL HISTORY CONTAINED IN THE VARIOUS TEIKI AND KYIJICIRCULATING WITH THE NOBLES. HE SORTED THROUGH THEM AND COMMANDED HEIDO-NO-ARE TO MEMORIZE THEM ALL. HE WASRENOWNED FOR HIS INTELLIGENCE AND BRIGHTNESS. LATER, EMPRESS GEMMEI ORDERED O NO YASUMARO TO COMPILE THEKOJIKI BASED ON WHAT ARE HAD MEMORIZED. THIS WAS COMPLETED IN 712. WHAT IS OF A PARTICULAR INTEREST FOR THISSTUDY IS A STORY THAT DESCRIBES TWO JAPANESE GODS, TAKEMIKAZUCHI AND TAKEMINEKATA. AS THE JAPANESE COAST WASSO BEAUTIFUL EACH OF THE TWO GODS WANTED IT FOR THEMSELVES. THEY MADE AN AGREEMENT. ONE WHO WINS IN AWRESTLING MATCH GETS TO RULE OVER THAT PART OF A LAND. THEY WRESTLED AT THE IZUMO COAST. THE WINNER SET HIS OWNDEPUTY TO RULE THAT AREA. THAT DEPUTY WAS THE FUTURE JAPANESE EMPEROR.THE LAST NOTABLE WRITTEN DOCUMENT THAT WE TOOK AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SPORT AND LITERATURE DATESFROM THE 12TH CENTURY. IT TELLS THE STORY ABOUT GOGMAGOG, A LEGENDARY GIANT OF SUCH PRODIGIOUS STRENGTH IN BRITISHFOLKLORE, WHO, TO THE 12TH CENTURY HISTORIA REGUM BRITANNIAE, WAS A GIANT INHABITANT OF ALBION THROWN OFF A CLIFFDURING A WRESTLING MATCH WITH CORINEUS, A COMPANION OF BRUTUS OF TROY (F. P. MILLER, VANDOME, & JOHN, 2010A;MONMOUTH & FALETRA, 2007). ACCORDING TO GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH\\'S ACCOUNT WHEN BRUTUS WAS HOLDING A FEASTWITH HIS COMPANIONS IN TOTNES SOME TWENTY GIANTS LED BY GOÉMAGOT DESCENDED ON THE COMPANY WHO MADE ADREADFUL SLAUGHTER. AT LAST THE GIANTS WERE ROUTED AND SLAIN EXCEPT FOR GOÉMAGOT WHO WAS CAPTURED SO THATCORINEUS COULD WRESTLE WITH HIM. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ENCOUNTER, CORINEUS AND THE GIANT, STANDING, FRONT TOFRONT, HELD EACH OTHER STRONGLY IN THEIR ARMS, AND PANTED ALOUD FOR BREATH, BUT GOÉMAGOT PRESENTLY GRASPINGCORINEUS WITH ALL HIS MIGHT, BREAKING THREE OF HIS RIBS, TWO ON HIS RIGHT SIDE AND ONE ON HIS LEFT. AT WHICHCORINEUS, HIGHLY ENRAGED, ROUSED UP HIS WHOLE STRENGTH, AND SNATCHING HIM UPON HIS SHOULDERS, RAN WITH HIM, ASFAST AS THE WEIGHT WOULD ALLOW HIM, TO THE NEXT SHORE, AND THERE GETTING UPON THE TOP OF A HIGH ROCK, HURLED DOWNTHE SAVAGE MONSTER INTO THE SEA; WHERE FALLING ON THE SIDES OF CRAGGY ROCKS, HE WAS TORN TO PIECES, AND COLORED THEWAVES WITH HIS BLOOD. THE PLACE WHERE HE FELL, TAKING ITS NAME FROM THE GIANT\\'S FALL, WAS, AND STILL IS, CALLED LAMGOÉMAGOT, THAT IS, GOÉMAGOT\\'S LEAP, TO THIS DAY (EVANS, 2008).53\\x0c© CENTRE FOR PROMOTING IDEAS, USA WWW.IJHSSNET.COM3. DISCUSSIONIT IS AN INTERESTING FACT THAT, IN ANCIENT TIMES, ATHLETES ANOINTED THEIR BODIES WITH OIL AS PERPETUA SAW IN HER VISION(CHRISTOPH, 1979). DURING THE ANCIENT GREEK OLYMPIC GAMES WRESTLERS FIRST ANOINTED THEIR BODIES WITH OLIVE OILTHEN THEY DUSTED THEM WITH POWDER TO MAKE THEM EASIER TO GRASP. THERE IS A VARIANT OF OIL WRESTLING IN THE MODERNTURKEY, CALLED KIRKPINAR. NATIONAL TURKISH WRESTLING IS A VERY OLD SPORT SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY BE THE WEST-ANATOLIAN VARIANT OF GREEK WRESTLING IN ANCIENT TIMES (C. MILLER, 2004). WHEN THE ROMANS CONQUERED THE GREEKS,THEY ABSORBED GREEK WRESTLING AND COMPETITIONS THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE ROMAN ARENA JUST AS PERPETUA SAW IN HERVISION. WRESTLING COMBATS TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH MORE BRUTAL AND MORE POPULAR GLADIATORIAL COMBATS AND OTHERUSUAL ARENA ACTIVITY. EVEN THE IMMENSE EGYPTIAN, PERPETUAS OPPONENT, IS A LOGICAL CHOICE. IN ANCIENT EGYPTIANCULTURE WRESTLING WAS EXTREMELY POPULAR. WRESTLING MOTIF WAS COMMON IN EGYPTIAN LITERARY AND MATERIAL CULTURE(POLIAKOFF, 1987). TO OVERCOME A NUBIJAN WRESTLING CHAMPION, DURING THE REIGN OF PHARAOH AKHENATON-A (1353 -1336 B.C.), WAS A GREAT HONOR (CARROLL, 1988). WE CAN ASSUME THAT IN THE ANCIENT ROME (1500 YEARS AFTER)APPROXIMATELY THE SAME HONOR WAS TO OVERCOME THE EGYPTIAN WRESTLING CHAMPION.IT IS INTERESTING HOW WE CAN CONNECT PERPETUA’S VISION WITH THE WRESTLING HISTORY AND WRESTLING MATCHES DESCRIBEDBY HOMER (COWPER & JOHNSON, 1791). ALL OTHER MENTIONED LITERARY WORKS DO NOT PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION ONWRESTLING DETAILS, BUT THEY RATHER TALK ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF THE HEROES, INTENSITY OF THE BATTLE AND/OR ABOUT THEDURATION OF THE BATTLE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE READ ABOUT GILGAMESH AND ENKIDU HOLDING EACH OTHER LIKE BULLS SHATTERINGTHE DOORPOST. ALSO, DURING THE CORINEUS AND GOÉMAGOT\\'S FIGHT WAS SO LOUD AND FEARFUL THAT ALL THE PEOPLE AROUNDTHEM THOUGHT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN AN EARTHQUAKE SOMEWHERE. TODAY, MATCHES BETWEEN EQUAL OPPONENTS CAN ALSOLAST VERY LONG. LET US REMEMBER THE MATCH HELD DURING THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN SWEDEN 1912. IT WAS A MATCHBETWEEN MARTIN KLEIN REPRESENTING FROM RUSSIA AND ALFRED ASIKAINEN REPRESENTING FINLAND. THE MATCH LASTED 11HOURS AND 40 MINUTES. IT IS THE LONGEST MATCH IN THE MODERN WRESTLING HISTORY. YUDHISTHIRA AND BHEEMA WRESTLEDFOR 27 DAYS, RUSTAM AND SOHRABA WRESTLED FOR 2 DAYS, JACOB AND ANGEL WRESTLED UNTIL DAWN, WHILE AJAX ANDODYSSEY WRESTLED IN A LONG AND EXHAUSTING MATCH.IN THE CONSIDERED LITERARY TEXTS ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS WIN THEIR DUELS, EXCEPT THE ODYSSEY. RUSTAM, BHEEMA,KRI§NA AND CORINEUS SOLVE THE FIGHT BY KILLING THE OPPONENT; BHEEMA EVEN PULLS APART THE OPPONENT\\'S BODY INTOTWO. BEOWULF DOES NOT KILL GRANDEL BUT HE PULLS APART GRENDEL\\'S ARM FROM HIS BODY. EVEN ANGEL HURTS JACOB\\'STHIGH. IN ANCIENT TIMES, WRESTLING, AS THE MOST POPULAR SPORT, HAD LOT OF FORMS. MALLA-YUDHA SOUTH ASIAN FORM OFCOMBAT-WRESTLING WAS VERY BRUTAL. IN ANCIENT CHINA THE SHUAI JIAO WAS A FORM OF FOLK WRESTLING, AND JIAO LI WAS AFORM OF A VERY BRUTAL MATCH OF SHUAI JIAO WHICH SUPPLEMENTED THROWING TECHNIQUES WITH STRIKES, BLOCKS AND JOINTLOCKS. WRESTLING WAS ALSO A PART OF ANCIENT GREEK PANKRACION (COMBINATION OF WRESTLING AND BOXING) WHICH WAS ABRUTAL MARTIAL ART WITH RECORDED DEATHS (GALEN & SINGER, 1997; NOMIKOS, NOMIKOS, MAVROGENIS, &PAPAGELOPOULOS, 2008; POLIAKOFF, 1987).THERE ARE ALSO DIFFERENT FORMS OF WRESTLING WHICH ARE BASED ON RULES WHICH FORBID BRUTALITY AND POTENTIALLYDANGEROUS GRIPS. WE FIND THE EXAMPLES OF SUCH MATCHES IN LITERARY TEXTS. FOR EXAMPLES, HOMER DESCRIBES A HEROOVERCOMING HIS OPPONENT BY THE RULES, WHILE IN THE JAPANESE FIGHT OF THE GODS AND GILGAMESH THE MATCH IS ALSOWON BY THE SURRENDER OF THE OPPONENT. IN ANCIENT GREEK WRESTLING FIGHTS AND ALSO WRESTLING TRAININGS WERE VERYPAINFUL AND SOMETIMES VERY BRUTAL. BUT AS THE AUDIENCE KNEW THE RULES VERY WELL THEY PREFERRED A FAIR FIGHT. JUDGESAND EVEN AUDIENCE INFLUENCED ON REGULARITY OF THE WRESTLING FIGHTS IN HOMER\\'S GREECE (NOMIKOS, ET AL., 2008;POLIAKOFF, 1987). SO THE OUTCOME OF THE FIGHTS WHICH HE DESCRIBED IS QUITE LOGICAL.IN ALL EPIC FIGHTS WE EXPECT THE FAIR FIGHT FROM THE MAIN HERO; THESE WORKS OFTEN CARRY AN EDUCATIONAL MESSAGE TOTHE READER, BUT NOT IN ALL THESE BATTLES. AFTER ALL NIGHT OF WRESTLING ANGEL INJURED JACOB TO END THE FIGHT. WHENROSTAM REALIZED THAT HE COULD LOSE THE FIGHT AND HIS HONOR HE STABS THE DAGGER IN SOHRABAS HEART. THESE ENDINGS DONOT COINCIDE WITH MODERN MORAL PRINCIPLES BUT WE MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE TIME AND CONDITIONS WHENTHESE WORKS ARE WRITTEN AS WELL AS PLOT OF THE TALE. THE HEROES OF THESE EPIC FIGHTS HAD DIFFERENT MOTIVES. ODYSSEYFIGHTS TO WIN THE ACHILLES\\'S ARMOR AND WEAPON, KRISNA, JARASINDHA AND JAPANESE GODS WRESTLE FOR LAND, CORINEUSAND BEOWULF WRESTLE TO SAVE THEIR PEOPLE FROM MONSTROUS TERROR. ATLANTA WRESTLES JUST TO OVERCOME THE OPPONENT,WHILE GILGAMESH ENDS THE FIGHT WITH EPIC FRIENDSHIP. EVEN WITH INTERESTING WRESTLING DETAILS, PERPETUA\\'S FIGHT IS APURE SYMBOLIC ONE. IN HER STRUGGLE SHE OVERCOMES THE EVIL AND PREPARES HERSELF FOR MARTYRDOM IN THE ROMAN ARENA.AS WE CAN CONCLUDE, DIFFERENCES CAUSED BY THE TEMPORAL, GEOGRAPHIC, CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS DISTANCES HAVE BEENCONNECTING WRESTLING THROUGH HISTORY FROM THE EARLY BEGINNINGS OF THE HUMANKIND.54\\x0cINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCE VOL. 3 NO. 5; MARCH 2013TWO WRESTLING MATCHES, THE FIRST BETWEEN A MYTHOLOGICAL GREEK HERO AJAX AND ODYSSEY AND THE SECOND BETWEENPELEUS AND ATLANTA, EPIC ARE OF OUR PARTICULAR INTEREST. WHEN ACHILES WAS KILLED, AJAX AND ODYSSEY BROUGHT HISBODY AND WEAPONS INTO A CAMP. AT THE FUNERAL CEREMONY, HELD IN HONOR OF THE DECEASED HERO, THE SPORT EVENTSWERE HELD. GODDESS THETIS, MOTHER OF ACHILLES, DECIDED THAT WHO WON IN A WRESTLING MATCH MAY TAKE WITH HIMACHILLES’ ARMOR AND WEAPON. AJAX AND ODYSSEY, DRAWN BY THE REWORD, DECIDED TO FIGHT. AFTER A LONG ANDEXHAUSTING MATCH THERE WAS NO WINNER. NESTOR SUGGESTED THAT THE TROJANS PRISONERS, WHO WITNESSED THE MATCH,SHOULD DECIDE ON WHO THE WINNER SHOULD BE. THEY DECIDED THAT IT SHOULD BE ODYSSEY. FURIOUS AJAX SUDDENLY LOSTHIS COMMON SENSE. HE TOOK OUT HIS SWARD AND SLAUGHTERED ALL THE CATTLE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE CAMP THINKING ITWERE THE ENEMIES. SEEING WHAT HE HAD DONE, HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.THERE IS, IN ADDITION, ANOTHER WRESTLING COMBAT RECORDED IN THE SAME EPICS. THIS STORY CONCERNS PELEUS, THETIS\\'SHUSBAND, AND ACHILLES’ FATHER. ACCORDING TO APOLLODORUS, GREEK SCHOLAR AND GRAMMARIAN (SMITH, 1880), AT THEFUNERAL GAMES HONORING PELIAS, ATLANTA ENTERED THE WRESTLING CONTESTS. HERE SHE GAINED MORE FAME BY SCORING AVICTORY OVER PELEUS.ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT WRESTLING COMBAT CAN BE TRACED IN THE BIBLE. TODAY WE KNOW THAT THE BIBLE, REFERRING TO ANYONE OF THE COLLECTIONS OF THE PRIMARY RELIGIOUS TEXTS OF JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY, WAS WRITTEN BETWEEN 1513 B.C.AND 98 A.D. IN IT ONE WRESTLING MATCH HAS BEEN IN THE FOCUS OF MANY DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE MUSLIMS, ON ONESIDE, AND THE CHRISTIANS AND THE JEW, ON THE OTHER. JACOB WRESTLING WITH THE ANGEL IS A BIBLICAL STORY COMMONLYDEPICTED IN ART. THE STORY APPEARS IN THE CHAPTER 32 OF GENESIS, AND IN THE CHAPTER 12 OF THE BOOK OF HOSEA.DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE TEXT, THE BEING WITH WHICH JACOB WRESTLED IS VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED. ONCE THAT BEING IS ANANGEL, ONCE A MAN, AND SOMETIMES EVEN GOD. HOWEVER, THE EVENT OCCURRED DURING JACOB\\'S JOURNEY BACK TO CANAAN.HE ROSE UP THAT NIGHT, AND TOOK HIS TWO WIVES, TWO WOMEN SERVANTS, AND HIS ELEVEN SONS, AND PASSED OVER THE FORDJABBOK. AFTER HE HAD SENT THEM ACROSS THE STREAM, HE SENT OVER ALL HIS POSSESSIONS. JACOB WAS LEFT ALONE.THAT NIGHT HE WRESTLED WITH A MAN UNTIL THE BREAKING OF THE DAY. WHEN THE MAN SAW THAT HE COULD NOT OVERPOWERHIM, HE TOUCHED THE HOLLOW OF HIS THIGH; AND THE HOLLOW OF JACOB\\'S THIGH WAS OUT OF JOINT, AS HE WRESTLED WITH HIM.THE MAN ASKED JACOB TO LET HIM DOWN BUT JACOB REFUSED TO GIVE IN AND PLEADED FOR A BLESSING FROM HIS OPPONENT.THE MAN ASKED HIM, “WHAT IS YOUR NAME?” “JACOB,” HE ANSWERED. THEN THE MAN SAID, “YOUR NAME WILL NO LONGERBE JACOB, BUT ISRAEL, BECAUSE YOU HAVE STRUGGLED WITH GOD AND WITH HUMANS AND HAVE OVERCOME.” JACOB SAID,“PLEASE TELL ME YOUR NAME.” BUT HE REPLIED, “WHY DO YOU ASK MY NAME?” THEN HE BLESSED HIM THERE. SO JACOBCALLED THE PLACE PENIEL, SAYING, “IT IS BECAUSE I SAW GOD FACE TO FACE, AND YET MY LIFE WAS SPARED.” AND AS HEPASSED OVER PENIEL THE SUN ROSE UPON HIM, AND HE HALTED UPON HIS THIGH. THEREFORE TO THIS DAY THE CHILDREN OF ISRAELDO NOT EAT THE TENDON ATTACHED TO THE SOCKET OF THE HIP, BECAUSE THE SOCKET OF JACOB’S HIP WAS TOUCHED NEAR THETENDON (PUBLISHERS, 2008).FOR WELL OVER 1,000 YEARS, SACRED STORIES AND HEROIC EPICS HAVE ALSO BEEN A PART OF THE HINDUISM MYTHOLOGY(DOWSON, 1870). IT IS INTERESTING TO MENTION THAT THE HISTORY OF SPORTS IN INDIA DATES BACK TO THE ANCIENT TIMES WITHREFERENCES FOUND IN THE VEDAS AND INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION. IN VILLAS MANI MAJRA, TIRUVEDACHARYA DESCRIBESMANY FASCINATING GAMES (BLOOMFIELD & SIRYA, 1964), NAMELY, ARCHERY, EQUITATION, HAMMER-THROWING AND CHARIOT-RACING. IN MANAS OLHAS (1135 A.D.), SOMESHWAR WRITES ABOUT BHRASHRAM (WEIGHT-LIFTING), BHRAMANSHRAM(WALKING) AND ALSO ABOUT MALL-STAMBHA WRESTLING (RAO).IN ADDITION, THE VEDAS BEING A LARGE BODY OF TEXTS, COMPOSED IN VEDIC SANSKRIT, THE TEXTS CONSTITUTE THE OLDESTLAYER OF SANSKRIT LITERATURE AND THE OLDEST SCRIPTURES OF HINDUISM, CONTAIN AN ANECDOTE ON THE WRESTLING MATCH(DALLAPICCOLA, 2002). KRISHNA, THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF HINDUISM, IS TRADITIONALLY ATTRIBUTED THE AUTHORSHIP OF THEBHAGAVAD GITA, ALSO MORE SIMPLY KNOWN AS GITA. GITA IS A 700-VERSE HINDU SCRIPTURE THAT IS PART OF THE ANCIENTSANSKRIT EPIC, THE MAHABHARATA, BUT IS FREQUENTLY TREATED AS A FREESTANDING TEXT, AND IN PARTICULAR, AS AN UPANISHADIN ITS OWN RIGHT, ONE OF THE SEVERAL BOOKS THAT CONSTITUTE GENERAL VEDIC TRADITION. AMONG ITS EIGHTEEN CHAPTERS,CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR BRINGS THE WRESTLING MATCH BETWEEN KRISNA AND KAMSA. KAMSA OR KANSA WAS THE BROTHER OFDEVAKI, AND RULER OF THE VRISHNI KINGDOM. HIS FATHER WAS KING UGRASENA AND HIS MOTHER WAS QUEEN PADMAVATI.HOWEVER, UPON THE ADVICE OF HIS PERSONAL CONFIDANTE, BANASURA, KAMSA DECIDED TO OVERTHROW HIS FATHER AND INSTALLHIMSELF AS THE KING OF MATHURA. KAMSA WAS TOLD IN A PROPHECY THAT THE EIGHTH CHILD OF DEVAKI WOULD KILL HIM ONEDAY. AS HE DID NOT WANT TO KILL DEVAKI HE DECIDED TO IMPRISON BOTH DEVAKI AND HER HUSBAND, VASUDEVA. IN THECONFINES OF THE PRISON, DEVAKI REPEATEDLY CONCEIVED, AND AN ENRAGED KAMSA MURDERED THE FIRST SIX CHILDREN. THESEVENTH CHILD, BALARAMA, WAS SAVED WHEN HE WAS MOVED TO ROHINI\\'S WOMB.51\\x0c'"

So is <a class=\"tipHelp\" title=\"culture\">culture</a>, the way of life specific to a group of people. <a class=\"tipHelp\" title=\"Cultural memory\">Cultural memory</a> is a form of <a class=\"tipHelp\" title=\"collective memory\">collective memory</a> shared by a group of people. Cultural memory is often stored in objects, such as museums or historical monuments.</p>\n",
              "<p>To understand culture, humans access a vast array of cultural symbols, such as books. Artifacts of the past provide insights into where we came from. Libraries and the internet store a seemingly infinite amount of data about what it means to be part of a culture. Cultural memory is the longest-lasting form of memory. Indeed, cultural memory can last for thousands of years.</p>\n",
              "<p>Like all forms of memory, cultural memory has important functions. For example, it crystallizes shared experiences. In doing so, cultural memory provides us with an understanding of the past and the values and norms of the group (or more accurately groups) to which we belong. It also creates a form of shared identity and a means for communicating this identity to new members. The most powerful forms of cultural memory may involve recollections of past <a class=\"tipHelp\" title=\"trauma\">trauma</a> experienced by groups of victims. For example, in Russia, their role in World War II—in which tens of millions of Russians were killed, more than any other nation—is still an important part of modern Russian identity. Because all groups have cultural memory, it can bring about a spirit of resistance or survival among marginalized or threatened groups of people. </p>\n",
              "<p>The main function of cultural memory is not to reminisce about the past, whether it be good or bad. Rather, it is to use knowledge of past experiences to avoid making the same mistakes again and again. Aleida Assman, an English professor who has also worked on memory theory since the 1960s, calls this “remembering forward.” Cultural memory enables culture to endure; it enables people to <a class=\"tipHelp\" title=\"adapt\">adapt</a> to their culture; and it enables cultures to adapt to new circumstances by retaining traces of what worked in the past.</p>\n",
